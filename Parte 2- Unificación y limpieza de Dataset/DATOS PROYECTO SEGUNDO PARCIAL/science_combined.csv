Yet, the benefits of digital technology can only be realised by mobilising global cooperation to close persistent digital divides and address the harms, risks, and uncertainties of digitalisation. To date, the global digital landscape is dominated by private technology companies and a few governments of technologically advanced countries, while less developed countries and civil society actors effectively have no voice. The goal of the United Nations’s (UN) Digital Cooperation initiative is to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs of digital transformation while ensuring that no-one is left behind. The UN’s Digital Cooperation identifies the main directions for action but also acknowledges that persistent governance gaps undermine its cooperation efforts. This paper argues that we can learn how to improve global cooperation to govern the digital space by drawing on experiences from global environmental governance. Based on an extensive literature review, I show how existing governance gaps in global digital cooperation can be analysed and addressed. Specifically, I focus on the implications for the UN and identify which roles and functions it could take. Online misinformation is used as a compelling illustration of how lessons derived from environmental governance can inform responses to digital problems. The paper outlines an agenda that can set UN Digital Cooperation on a path towards success in mitigating the uncertainties the digital future will bring.",2024

Combining the dual function of sensors and actuators, smart materials are configured as excellent allies of adaptive technologies. Their responsiveness facilitates the dynamic interaction between the building and the environment through the building envelope configured as a living interface, similar to the skin of natural organisms. This study aims to explore the current trends and potential applications of smart materials to define biomimetic solutions for environmentally adaptive building envelopes. Starting from specifying the fine distinction between adaptive and responsive solutions, the PRISMA method is used to conduct a systematic literature review, together with a bibliometric analysis, to identify the main common occurrences of the keywords, the predominant geographical areas and the main sources. Only materials that respond to the environmental triggers of light, temperature and water were considered to create a design matrix that enriches the implementation phase of the biomimetic-Adaptive Model and provides researchers with a new useful tool for the biomimetic design phases. The study shows how smart materials can be used to realise the responsive functions of the biomimetic envelope, capable of regulating temperature, shielding solar radiation, filtering or reacting to variable environmental parameters. The application of smart materials in architecture is still limited, paving the way for future research discoveries and synergistic collaboration between architectural technologies, biology, and material sciences, and leading to a more sustainable built environment.",2023

The provision of health services is necessary and a civil right, being one of the dimensions proposed in Smart Cities, represented by Smart Healthcare. This model of cities, as well as its dimensions, have great appeal in the technological application, as the main means of promoting smart services. However, it appears that the approach to the role of the citizen in the promotion of intelligence is neglected, leaving questions about the role of the citizen in Smart Cities. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the technological structures applied in Smart Healthcare, allowing us to identify the role of the citizen in the promotion of smarter health services. A systematic literature review was carried out using the Methodi Ordinatio, resulting in a portfolio composed of 26 articles with scientific relevance. From the content analysis, four main approaches were identified, as well as technologies and methods to address one of the biggest challenges of health technologies: data security and privacy. From this, the role of the citizen in the Smart Healthcare was evidenced, aiming to contribute to the planning of projects and the development of future research to consider with more attention the participation of citizens.",2022

However, very few MPAs are effective and meet their conservation objectives mainly due to a lack of coordination, participation or resources. For instance, in the Mediterranean Sea there are about 1062 MPAs, but 72% of them do not have effective regulations to reduce human impacts on biodiversity and current efforts are insufficient in managing human uses for the conservation and protection of marine biodiversity. This makes necessary to seek new ways or instruments for their management. In this sense, digitalization and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can provide tools to facilitate the development of MPAs management in a more effective, participatory and efficient manner because automatic agents report their information and digest the data no matter the situation. In the specific case of Spain, one of the main problems identified for MPAs management is the overlapping of different kinds of protected areas in the same territory. In addition, these are managed by different administrations (Regional, National). An example of this situation is the Sierra Helada Marine Natural Park (SHMP) in Alicante. Within its territorial scope there are 3 MPAs with different protection figures that overlap each other, SHMP, the Natura 2000 site of Serra Gelada i la Marina Baixa and a fishing protected area. These MPAs are managed by different regional governmental bodies, and have a natural resources action plan in use, supported by a management collaboration agreement with the town councils in the area and the Altea Nautical Club. In the SHMP, Posidonia oceanica (PO) is one of the most important ecosystems and its presence prompted its creation and declaration. PO is a marine angiosperm endemic to the Mediterranean Sea that forms extensive meadows from the sea surface to 30–40 m depth and which provides essential goods and services: it improves water quality and protect beaches against erosion. PO meadows are recognized as biodiversity hotspots, and as major carbon sinks, but they are very sensitive to human activities. However, although many regulations protect PO, there are still significant threats to their conservation. In this regard, the research presented in this paper is the development of an ICT-based software tool, called Smart MPA, that includes an analysis framework based on management and governance indicators specific for PO and a database on PO that includes and combines different sources of information, including the results obtained of the evaluation of the analytical framework, input from information from citizens or MPA users, for example, by sending photos to report infractions in PO at specific points and from satellite images or underwater UAVs. The main objective of the Smart MPA tool is to offer services applied to PO management, either through the analysis of governance indicators or by facilitating the integration of citizen information to be used in management activities. The tool has been tested and used by the management staff of SHMP to be applied to an annual monitoring of management measures to develop an adaptive management of PO and the SHMP. After that, a semi-structured interview was carried out to collect information on the analytical framework co-developed and a survey was created where management staff of SHMP have given their perception on the usability of the tool and on the environmental problems affecting the conservation of PO in SHMP. According to the results obtained, the management of PO in SHMP is efficient, at a general level, with the lack of adequate funding being a limiting factor. The main threats are boat anchoring and organic pollution. In conclusion, the Smart MPA tool and the analytical framework are instruments that can facilitate the management and promote good environmental governance processes for the conservation of PO meadows in SHMP. At the same time, the importance of exploring mobile apps to increase citizen participation and mitigate threats and impacts on PO have been highlighted.",2023

However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.",2023

This includes social/societal factors, goals and implications that have recently been studied under the label of social innovation. Furthermore, the emergence of bioeconomy as a paradigm and policy goal has become a driver for a variety of innovation processes on company and institutional levels. Our article provides a tentative definition of “innovation governance” and attempts a state-of-art review of innovation governance research in the forest sector. For structuring the research field, we propose to distinguish between organizational/managerial, policy or innovation studies. For the forestry sector, specifically, we suggest to distinguish between studies focusing on (i) innovative governance of forest management and forest goods and services; on (ii) the governance of innovation processes as such, or (iii) on specific (transformational) approaches that may be derived from combined goals such as innovation governance for sustainability, regional development, or a bioeconomy. Studies in the forest sector are picking up new trends from innovation research that increasingly include the role of societal changes and various stakeholders such as civil society organizations and users. They also include public-private partnership models or participatory governance.

Over the past two decades, global health diplomacy, foreign policy for health, and global health policy have changed substantially. Diplomacy is a constitutive part of the system of global health governance. COVID-19 hit the world when multilateral cooperation was subject to major challenges, and global health has since become integral to geopolitics. The importance of global health diplomacy, especially at WHO, in keeping countries jointly committed to improving health for everyone, has once again been shown. Through a systematic review, this Series paper explores how international relations concepts and theories have been applied to better understand the role of power in shaping positions, negotiations, and outcomes in global health diplomacy. We apply an international relations perspective to reflect on the effect that those concepts and theories have had on global health diplomacy over the past two decades. This Series paper argues that a more central role of international relations concepts and theories in analysing global health diplomacy would help develop a more nuanced understanding of global health policy making. However, the world has changed to an extent that was not envisioned in academic discourse. This shift calls for new international relations concepts and theories to inform global health diplomacy.",2022

In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions.

Its baseline is the available standardised and harmonised methods for nanotechnology developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In order to identify improvements and needs for new themes in standardisation work, an analysis of the state-of-the-art concepts and interpretations of risk governance of nanotechnology was performed. Eleven overall areas of action were identified, each including a subset of specific topics. Themes addressed include physical chemical characterisation, assessment of hazard, exposure, risk and socio-economic factors, as well as education & training and social dialogue. This has been visualised in a standardisation roadmap spanning a timeframe of ten years and including key outcomes and highlights of the analysis. Furthermore, the roadmap indicates potential areas of action for harmonisation and standardisation (H&S) for nanomaterials and nanotechnology. It also includes an evaluation of the current level (limited, moderate, intense) of ongoing H&S activities and indicates the time horizon for the different areas of action. As the identified areas differ in their state of development, the number and type of actions varied widely amongst the different actions towards achieving standardisation.

Synthesising these, a research approach is adopted in which a Technological Innovation System (TIS) analysis is combined with a transformational perspective to identify a broader range of success and failure factors. This study analyses smart grid innovation system development. The main research question is: What systemic and transformational failures are identified in the development of smart grid innovation in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2021 by combining TIS and a transformational perspective? The question is answered by mapping the events to TIS functions and identifying both ‘systemic failures’ and ‘transformational failures’. Transformational failures are linked to events outside the smart grid TIS that work against the alignment and harmonising of activities within the TIS. Results show that the smart grid innovation system experienced three periods and that it suffers from various structural and transformational failures. TIS functions like knowledge diffusion, and the creation of legitimacy were only fulfilled to a limited extent. Consequently, smart grid innovation is currently still not considered a mainstream technology in the energy transition, and there is little attention to the role of end-users. The study ends with suggestions for future research, including the suitability of the research approach for other contexts and when applied to other energy system innovations.",2023

Health care governance research has traditionally had a strong focus on the size and composition (i.e., the attributes) of the governing bodies, but less attention has been given to the dynamics, processes, and roles. Furthermore, evidence regarding the interconnection between the board and the executive management is lacking. This systematic literature review is thus intended to give a detailed summary of the attributes, the dynamics, and the processes, as well as the roles of governing bodies, by synthesizing the findings of published empirical studies. The framework of Kane et al. (2009) was used to position the results, taking into account external constraints and outputs/performance. Sixty-three studies were included in the systematic review. The majority of these studies deal with attributes (n = 34) and roles (n = 27); the smallest number of studies (n = 11) focus on dynamics and processes. There is a lack of consistency in the research findings on attributes and there is too little research into the dynamics and processes of hospital governance. However, it has been shown that clinical participation on the hospital board and the focus on quality in hospital board roles can have a beneficial effect. The studies do not provide sufficient direction on what best practice for governing hospitals should be. For this reason, we here provide a useful framework for understanding the aspects of governance and their impact on performance in hospitals and compare these with general corporate governance literature. Therefrom we propose avenues for further research.",2020

However, the domination of human-induced drivers such as climate change, rapid demographic escalation, alteration in land use, industrialisation, and an increase in water demand has further stressed the unfrozen freshwater resources. This review provides a comprehensive literature-based analysis on different assessment methodologies for groundwater governance, and critically analysed the applicability and knowledge gaps in the assessment methodologies for evaluating groundwater governance under climatic and nonclimatic stresses. Furthermore, in the absence of a designated groundwater governance framework under stress, the study emphasized the need for developing a ready-to-use groundwater governance framework to assess the existing state of governance, tackling the prevailing knowledge gaps. A multidimensional framework consisting of key groundwater governance elements, the inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalised groups, current and future stressors, and an approach for aggregating multiple elements would overcome the limitations in previous assessment methodologies. Additionally, this framework would contribute to understanding current governance provisions and the capacity to manage those provisions, realise the strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement, and quantitatively visualise the prevailing state of groundwater governance for planning multiple strategies to possible threats and conflicts from the stresses.

To date, there is no systematic content analysis of NAPs from countries of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN). As the validity periods of most NAPs are ending, an analysis now will provide an opportunity to improve subsequent iterations of these NAPs. We analysed the current NAPs of ten ASEAN countries. We explored their objective alignment with GAP and performed content analysis using an AMR governance framework. Themes were broadly classified under five governance areas: policy design, implementation tools, monitoring and evaluation, sustainability, and One Health engagement. We identified policy priorities, useful features of NAPs, and specific areas that should be strengthened, including accountability, sustained engagement, equity, behavioural economics, sustainability plans and transparency, international collaboration, as well as integration of the environmental sector.

The application of autonomous technology in food supply chains gives rise to a number of ethical considerations associated with the interaction between human and technology, human-technology-plant and human-technology-animal. These considerations and their implications influence technology design, the ways in which technology is applied, how the technology changes food supply chain practices, decision-making and the associated ethical aspects and outcomes.
Scope and approach
Using the concept of reflexive governance, this paper has critiqued existing reflective food-related ethical assessment tools and proposed the structural elements required for reflexive governance architectures which address both the sharing of data, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in food supply chains.
Key findings and conclusions
Considering the ethical implications of using autonomous technology in real life contexts is challenging. The current approach, focusing on discrete ethical elements in isolation e.g., ethical aspects or outcomes, normative standards or ethically orientated compliance-based business strategies, is not sufficient in itself. Alternatively, the application of more holistic, reflexive governance architectures can inform consideration of ethical aspects, potential ethical outcomes, in particular how they are interlinked and/or interdependent, and the need for mitigation at all lifecycle stages of technology and food product conceptualisation, design, realisation and adoption in the food supply chain. This research is of interest to those who are undertaking ethical deliberation on data sharing, and the use of AI and machine learning in food supply chains.",2023

While smart farming concepts are well described in the literature, the potential societal impacts of smart farming are less conspicuous. To demonstrate how smart farming solutions could influence future agricultural production, agri-business and rural communities and their constituents, this article compares smart farming approaches and reasons behind the pursuit of smart farming solutions by the U.S. and South Korea. The article compares agricultural assets and productivity among the two countries as well as the technical and societal challenges impacting agricultural production as a basis to understanding the motivations behind and pathways for developing smart farming solutions. In doing so, the article compares some of the technological and social advantages and disadvantages of smart farming, dependending on the choice and implementation of smart farming solutions. The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.",2021

This article argues that transformative governance is needed to enable the transformative change necessary for achieving global sustainability goals. Based on a literature review, the article unpacks this concept of transformative governance. It is: integrative, to ensure local solutions also have sustainable impacts elsewhere (across scales, places, issues and sectors); inclusive, to empower those whose interests are currently not being met and represent values embodying transformative change for sustainability; adaptive, enabling learning, experimentation, and reflexivity, to cope with the complexity of transformative change; and pluralist, recognizing different knowledge systems. We argue that only when these four governance approaches are: implemented in conjunction; operationalized in a specific manner; and focused on addressing the indirect drivers underlying sustainability issues, governance becomes transformative.",2021

However, effectively harnessing the power of crowdsourced data within the complex landscape of urban tourism governance, especially in China marked by rapid growth and dynamic shifts in the tourism market, remains hindered by institutional constraints and capacity limitations. This study critically examines three pivotal challenges in urban tourism governance in China, stemming from the ever-evolving tourism demand dynamics: resource management, tourism promotion, and regional collaboration. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for tourism governance that capitalizes on crowdsourced data, comprising eight distinct analytical functions. To validate the efficacy of this novel approach grounded in crowdsourced information, empirical tests were conducted in Shenzhen and Jiangmen, China, using data sourced from Dianping.com, often dubbed the “Yelp of China.” The dataset encompassed 1,496 tourist attractions and 184,357 tourist reviews for Shenzhen, along with 559 attractions and 2,811 reviews for Jiangmen. By leveraging the proposed framework and its designated functions, we formulate policy recommendations for the advancement of tourism in Shenzhen and Jiangmen. Finally, we explore the potential advantages of adopting the crowdsourced information-based approach to tourism management, shedding light on its implications for both governmental and corporate entities.",2023

This study aims to investigate the challenges of rapid urban population growth and explore how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be utilized to foster the development of smart cities. Specifically, it seeks to understand how the integration of ICT can contribute to enhancing urban resilience, promoting urban sustainability, and improving citizens' quality of life. The study relied on a literature review, appraisals of fifteen (15) different Smart City software applications and their characteristics (spanning various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, all related to sustainability and resilience), and thirty (30) case studies cutting across sustainability and resilience. Furthermore, thematic analysis from the case studies was used to evaluate the benefits of smart city applications mapped to the six (6) action areas of Smart City. Based on the findings from case studies and smart city software analysis, rapid urbanisation presents multifaceted challenges like traffic congestion, disaster management, environmental degradation, community engagement, economic disparities, and so on. However, adopting Smart City software applications and aligning with various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, play pivotal roles in addressing these challenges. Further findings reveal that the benefits of smart city software align with the action areas of smart cities, including Governance, Mobility, Economy, Environment, Living, and People.

It concentrates on the role of and interaction between stakeholders and technology in the smart city transformation process. Knowledge and insight into these developmental processes and core scenarios are scarce and necessary, as they can contribute to a possible acceleration and increase in the effectiveness of smart city transformation strategies. As a result of a systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b) downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback. Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the smart city processes in which they participate.",2024

The need for the use of information and communication technology in various forms is needed in such cities. There are different dimensions that are to be considered for smart city planning and implementation. This complexity of the dimension, the use of technology, and their integration bring the risk perspectives into the implementation of the smart city concept. If such risks are not adequately understood and addressed, they can create issues in terms of privacy and security and, therefore, the functioning of smart cities. In this review, the identification of dimensions, smart city assessment tools, the available technologies, and the technical and non-technical risk parameters related to smart cities implementation are discussed. The current methods of risk assessment and the possible enhancements are highlighted. The findings of the literature review illustrate that not all smart cities adapt all of the smart city dimensions.

The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications.

The ability of smart healthcare strategies to improve efficiency, patient's outcomes and delivery of quality healthcare has motivated and committed governments and policy makers to invest in this innovation. However, uptake and usage of smart healthcare strategies has not been successful as anticipated, and this is due to a number of challenges faced by different stakeholders during the adoption of these strategies. The objective of this paper is to systematically check published literature to identify and compile a comprehensive list of challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. Knowledge of these potential challenges gives stakeholders awareness and better prospects of dealing with the challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. A systematic literature review was conducted. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for full text, peer reviewed, English language articles that reported the challenges for successful adoption of smart healthcare management strategies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to select eligible articles. After the full screening, 26 articles that met the criteria were analysed and reported. Three main themes of challenges that affect the adoption of smart healthcare strategies have been identified based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework.

IoT (Internet of Things) systems are at the centre of smart city applications, as traditional cloud computing is insufficient for satisfying the critical requirements of smart IoT systems. Due to the nature of smart city applications, massive IoT data may contain sensitive information; hence, various privacy-preserving methods, such as anonymity, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, have been utilised over the years. Furthermore, limited concern has been given to the resource consumption for data privacy-preserving in edge computing environments, which are resource-constrained when compared with cloud data centres. In particular, differential privacy (DP) has been an effective privacy-preserving method in the edge computing environment. However, there is no dedicated study on DP technology with a focus on smart city applications in the edge computing environment. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study on DP in edge computing-based smart city applications, covering various aspects, such as privacy models, research methods, mechanisms, and applications. Our study focuses on five areas of data privacy, including data transmitting privacy, data processing privacy, data model training privacy, data publishing privacy, and location privacy. In addition, we investigate many potential applications of DP in smart city application scenarios. Finally, future directions of DP in edge computing are envisaged.

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda.

This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4.

This approach has been widely adopted at multiple scales of governance in conservation and sustainability sectors including by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Yet the implications of governing through targets have not been fully scrutinized for the ways that targets and their associated indicators shape the work by global conventions, including the activities pursued by state and non-state actors. We systematically reviewed, coded and assessed the peer-reviewed scientific literature produced in relation to the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABTs) to demonstrate the types of scientific action that the Aichi targets have motivated, and assess how this work serves to reinforce particular visions of what conservation is and how it should be done. We find widespread support for target-based governance in the scientific literature. We also find uneven attention across the targets (e.g. mostly the protected areas target), to particular elements within specific targets (e.g. the area-based element of the protected areas target), measured by particular forms of knowledge (i.e. primarily biophysical data aggregated at a global scale). We argue that the uneven scientific action associated with the ABTs arises from the interplay among target elements that can be readily measured (e.g. by existing single-metric indicators) and long-standing institutional commitments (e.g. to protected areas expansion). With the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework on the immediate horizon, there is a timely opportunity to reflect on the role of targets within the CBD and beyond.",2021

The integration of emerging technologies, such as smart grid solutions, energy storage systems, and regional power interconnections, offers opportunities for a sustainable and reliable power system. Recommendations for Ghana's power sector focus on diversification, grid flexibility, infrastructure upgrades, energy efficiency, institutional strengthening, and regional cooperation. Implementing these recommendations holds the promise of building a resilient, affordable, and environmentally sustainable power system for Ghana's future.",2023

This paper analyses a sample of these SCLs to assess their role in the scaling up of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives. To analyse these hydrogen SCLs, we embellish a novel conceptual framework that brings together Sustainability, Systems Thinking, and Governance (SSG) literatures. The results reveal noteworthy scheme differences in motivation, approach, criteria, and governance; highlighting the complex, interconnected, and dynamic reality within which energy systems are embedded. We consider whether the sustainable utilisation of renewable hydrogen is well-served by the proliferation of SCLs and recommend an SSG-informed approach. An SSG approach will better promote collaboration towards an authoritative, global, multistakeholder, compromise on hydrogen certification that balances economic considerations with social, and environmental dimensions.",2024

Drawing on previous work on feminist home-city geographies, this paper proposes four analytical frames for reflecting on the relationship between urban and domestic space in digital geographies: governance, domestication, thresholds, and dwelling. The paper explores each lens through a critical review of recent literature in digital geographies and related fields. It weaves this review through a speculative reading of the Eco Delta Smart City, an experimental development building the smart city from the home up in Busan, South Korea. We show how each lens calls attention to distinct sets of questions, actors, agendas, and relations–thus refusing any single reading of the project or of the broader trends around digitalization of which it is a part. In the process, we trace how digitalization does not simply trouble existing spatial categories, but rather makes them manifest in new ways for differently situated subjects.",2024

An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.",2021

Decision-making is often closely informed by energy system modelling, making energy models a crucial tool to foster a multi-level governance system that is based on mutual understanding and coordination across scales. Here, we review 186 energy modelling studies and identify challenges and opportunities for the energy modelling community to take into account and facilitate multi-level governance systems. We show that current energy modelling practices typically focus on and aim to support a single scale, largely overlooking the multi-level nature of energy governance. Embedding multi-level governance throughout the energy modelling process entails significant obstacles but is crucial for ensuring such approaches continue to provide timely and salient decision-support.",2022

When the imperative of urban economic and spatial growth is taken as a given, the mechanisms that perpetuate it remain unexplored and unquestioned. Lack of attention to such mechanisms, and specifically the politics of urban land use, can lead to ineffective planning and maladaptation. In this review, we explore the intersection of scholarship on urban climate adaptation governance and the political economy of urban development to identify the specific contemporary mechanisms that perpetuate uneven patterns of urban vulnerability and undermine adaptation planning. We are guided by three questions: What are the mechanisms that urban managers employ to assign rights and responsibilities to land, and thus allocate spatial exposure to risk? How is land implicated in cities’ efforts to finance themselves and their activities, and what are the implications for adaptation? What mechanisms enable urban actors to protect themselves from risk and respond to uncertainty? We emphasize the need to place urban climate governance within the broader political dynamics of urban development for more effective, equitable and ultimately sustainable vulnerability interventions. We find that instruments of urban development are often supporting the prioritization of economic rewards over equitable and just distribution of risk and rights to adaptation benefits. We conclude by highlighting the “uncomfortable knowledge” that if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved, the mechanisms of urban development and associated actors that shape, steer and utilize these instruments for a variety of means and goals, must be made visible and addressed.",2022

Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in addressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and resource depletion. Yet, the characteristics and implications of digitalized environmental governance are still under-conceptualized. In this perspective, we distinguish three dimensions of governance: (1) seeing and knowing, (2) participation and engagement, and (3) interventions and actions. For each dimension, we provide a critical perspective on the shifts that digital technologies generate in governance. We argue against the assumption that the use of digital technologies automatically results in improved outcomes or in more democratic decision-making. Instead, attention needs to be paid to the wider political and normative context in which digital technologies are proposed, designed, and used as environmental governance tools. We conclude with key questions for academics and policymakers to broaden the debate on responsible design and use of digital technologies in environmental governance.",2022

This review identifies multiple potential co-benefits, as well as a range of risk factors which could affect delivery. In addition, we identified that several co-benefits are interconnected, whereby certain co-benefits cannot occur until other co-benefits have first been achieved. We propose three dimensions of SLES co-benefits and risks: process, impact, and distribution to aid understanding of how, where, why and when these co-benefits or risks could arise and who might be in receipt of them.

The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data.

These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis.

Existing medical care for peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, and other forms of noncoronary vascular disease fails to integrate mobility, pain levels, and other real-time patient-generated health data, instead relying on formal hospital- or clinic-based evaluations. Wearable technology, such as smartwatches, is increasingly common and offers an opportunity to improve care by allowing the collection and use of these types of data.
Methods
We searched English language publications in MEDLINE and reviewed some of our work to perform this narrative review of wearable technology for noncoronary vascular disease.
Results
A wide range of patient-generated data may be collected using wearable technology using a spectrum of devices and platforms. There is very limited but growing work using wearable technology focused on noncoronary vascular disease. Preoperative mobility monitoring, reduction of postdischarge readmission after lower limb revascularization, and improvement of medication compliance are important examples of potential applications. We also identified several barriers to widespread use and acceptance of wearables such as patient acceptance, medical team burden, and data useability.
Conclusions
Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, offer the potential to fundamentally alter the management of noncoronary vascular disease by collecting real-time patient-generated data. There are several promising applications such as perioperative monitoring and medication compliance. Additional work on regulatory issues, cost-effectiveness, workflow integration, and acceptance by patients and clinicians will need to be completed before widespread use of wearables.",2024

Consequently, the demand for battery raw materials is continuously growing. As an illustration, to meet the net-zero emissions targets, the electric vehicle market demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite will increase 26-times, 6-times, 12-times, and 9-times respectively between 2021 and 2050. There are diverse challenges in meeting this demand, requiring the world to embrace technological and knowledge advancements and new investments without provoking conflicts between competing goals. The uncertainties in a sustainable supply of battery minerals, environmental, social and governance complexities, and geopolitical tensions throughout the whole battery value chain have shaped the global and regional concerns over the success of transport decarbonization. Here, focusing on the entire value chain of electric vehicle batteries, the approaches adopted by regulatory agencies, governments, mining companies, vehicle and battery manufacturers, and all the other stakeholders are evaluated. Bringing together all these aspects, this literature review broadens the scope for providing multifaceted solutions necessary to optimize the goal of transport decarbonization while upholding sustainability criteria.

Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community.

The current literature lacks a contextual and processual understanding of AI adoption and diffusion in public administration to be able to explore such tensions. Previous studies have outlined risks, benefits, and challenges with the use of AI in public administration. However, a large gap remains in understanding AI tensions as they relate to public value creation. Through a systematic literature review grounded in public value management and the resource-based view of the firms, we identify technology-organisational-environmental (TOE) contextual variables and absorptive capacity as factors influencing AI adoption as discussed in the literature.

As an innovation paradigm ‘co-creation’ is believed to produce more legitimate and inclusive innovation processes, however, in the context of energy transitions there is still no consistent understanding of what the concept means and implies. This paper investigates the links between co-creation and wind energy development to explore the (potential) role of co-creation for research and practice. We do that through an exploratory systematic review of 51 papers that refer to co-creation and co-production in relation to wind energy development. The review identifies three different understandings of co-creation in the literature, namely co-production of identities and representations, co-creation of innovation in sociotechnical systems, and co-creation as participatory governance. The three perspectives capture how co-creation comes about and how it shapes relations between actors present in the sociotechnical assemblages of wind energy development. We show how the use of the concept of co-creation suggests new roles for citizens as co-creators and co-producers of electricity and planning decisions. We subsequently discuss what these roles suggest for the understanding of participation in renewable energy development and transitions more broadly.",2021

Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) will significantly contribute to such adaptation and mitigation. In global, regional, and African contexts, Ethiopia represents a useful case study from which much can be learned. Therefore, the fourfold objectives of this Ethiopia-focused review were to i) synthesize adoption studies of more than seven CSAPs; ii) examine their adoption status, including gender considerations, socioeconomic benefits, and constraints to CSAP adoption; iii) identify gaps in the current CSAPs adoption literature, and iv) highlight future CSAP research and policy directions. Following a systematic literature review procedure, 100 articles published between 2001 and 2021 on adoption of CSAPs in Ethiopia were reviewed. Although all the publications were about the highlands of Ethiopia, over 80% came from the regions of Amhara, Oromiya, and South Nations and Nationalities. The most-adopted practice was soil and water conservation (SWC), with a mean adoption rate of 61.5%, followed by integrated soil fertility management, and agroforestry with mean adoption rates of 56.5% and 48.8%, respectively. Gender analysis was integrated in the studies at varying levels, including in all improved livestock management initiatives; just over half the SWC initiatives; and over 75% of the remaining five practices. Quantified socioeconomic benefits were reported in only 46 papers. Greater farm income; increased land productivity; higher yields; increased food availability; and reduced household poverty were among the reported benefits of adopters compared to their counterparts. Among the aggregated constraints, socioeconomic factors and knowledge/awareness were ranked the two highest, followed by labor shortage and limited market access. The study highlighted research gaps, especially a lack of national-scale studies and studies focusing on drought-prone regions. Additionally, 37% and 46% of the studies respectively, didn’t consider i) gender, and ii) analysis of socioeconomic benefits of CSAP adoption. This Ethiopian review reveals a need to fill research gaps in methodologies and practices, and at all levels in all regions, particularly in drought-prone regions. It identifies those CSAPs which could contribute more to addressing climate change, and emphasizes the need for greater gender inclusion. Policy-related actions should i) boost CSAP-related knowledge; ii) support optimizing their socioeconomic benefits; iii) address labor shortages; iv) improve access to irrigation, markets; credit, and farmers’ social organizations; and v) strengthen land tenure. In future, deploying remote-sensing technology, artificial intelligence and modelling approaches, and implementing Agricultural Weather Index-Based Insurance may also support CSAPs adoption.",2024

Nanotechnology is one of the technologies that could enable such a green growth. This paper focuses on advanced nanomaterials that actively respond to external stimuli, also known as ‘smart nanomaterials’, and which are already on the market or in the research and development phase for non-medical applications such as in agriculture, food, food packaging and cosmetics. A review shows that smart nanomaterials and enabled products may present new challenges for safety and sustainability assessment due to their complexity and dynamic behaviour. Moreover, existing regulatory frameworks, in particular in the European Union, are probably not fully prepared to address them. What is missing today is a systematic and comprehensive approach that allows for considering sustainability aspects hand in hand with safety considerations very early on at the material design stage.

The design of these dashboards typically consolidates information into a single view for government and industry to efficiently and effectively monitor the performance of urban systems – such as those of energy, built form, transport, culture, performance, innovation and health. Many of these dashboards focus on a one-way flow of data and thus do not cater specifically to the functions of public participation, community engagement and collaboration. With growing concerns in digital democracy, there is an increasing demand for software and tools that maximise human-centred design elements and include such participatory and collaborative features. The current trajectory of their development can be reframed to support this.

The aim of this review is to examine the challenges to transformative governance of agroecosystems, and the potential to apply existing paradigms of adaptiveness in agroecosystems for this transformation. Agricultural production landscapes have been found to be a key level of governance for realizing sustainability transformations of food systems and the landscape concept has been a key paradigm for managing multiple social and ecological objectives at a landscape scale. An examination of the landscape concept using five transformative governance characteristics and applying the earth system governance research lenses illustrated two key areas for further investigation and action for transformative governance. The first is landscape design for continuous social and ecological changes and evolving understandings of sustainability, and the second is the allocation of landscape costs, rights and benefits in present and future decision-making and among human and non-human entities.

Traffic congestion and air pollution continue to be serious concerns, especially in large cities, and going forward, this is not sustainable. Urban transport around the world is facing challenges, such as air pollution and inefficient use of resources, that often inhibit economic development. Simply building more roads cannot address such challenges. There is a need to integrate the urban infrastructure through smart connectivity. Smart mobility, as a vital cornerstone of a smart city, will potentially reduce traffic jams, commuting times, and road crashes and create an opportunity for passengers to customize their journeys. In fact, planning smart mobility solutions is among the top challenges for large cities around the world. It involves a set of deliberate actions backed by sophisticated technologies. The different elements and dimensions that characterize smart mobility are investigated to depict the overall picture surrounding the smart mobility domain. Additionally, the trends, opportunities, and threats inherent to smart mobility are addressed. There are four segments of smart mobility that are highlighted in this paper: intelligent transport systems, open data, big data analytics, and citizen engagement. These segments are all inter-related and play a crucial role in the successful implementation of smart mobility.",2021

To meet this demand, one candidate mechanism to increase production is to increase housing and manage more birds. However, this practice, along with labour shortages and increasing biosecurity practices will make it increasingly difficult for producers to monitor the production, health, and welfare status of all their birds. Employing smart poultry management systems is necessary to increase production while minimizing costs and the use of resources. Smart poultry management systems include precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies such as smart sensors, automation of farm processes, and data driven decision making platforms. Many new technologies will have great implications for poultry production in the areas of the poultry house environment, bird welfare, precision feeding, and rapid detection of infectious disease. As smart sensors collect data in real-time on a variety of parameters from poultry operations, large amounts of data will be generated. To make best use of this data, big data analytical tools must be employed to produce data driven decisions. Additionally, the devices that will be incorporated into smart poultry management systems will be connected to the Internet allowing for the formation of Internet of things (IoT) farm networks. IoT technologies allow for communication between farm sensors, devices, and equipment, and will lead to the automation of multiple farm procedures.

For an agrarian and climate-sensitive developing country like India, CC is an additional burden, as rapid population growth, industrialisation and depletive exploitation of resources are already exerting pressure on ecological and socio-economic systems. It is in this context that this study was undertaken to gain insights into the CC scenario in Aravalli district of Gujarat state (India), its impacts on smallholder farmers, the adoption of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices, current policy options and programs, as well as the challenges confronting sustainability of CSA practices. An electronic review of published peer-reviewed journal articles and reports from scientific databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core collection, Science Direct and Google scholar) indicated that CC has negatively impacted smallholder farmers in Aravalli district with a poised potential to exacerbate inequality, derail smallholder farmers' livelihoods, and thereby hampering sustainable economic growth.The major reported impacts have been witnessed as droughts, disparities in precipitation patters, heat waves and temperature extremes, floods, emergence of resistant agricultural pests and increased prevalence of crop diseases. In response, smallholder farmers have adopted certain water, land, livestock, and crop oriented CSA management practices to cope-up with the impacts of CC. Being a nascent district, most national, state and district policies and program interventions are at proposal and initial execution stages. The review highlights the need to undertake more empirical research to gain a deeper understanding of the emerging patterns ofCSA and their impacts on agricultural development and livelihoods of farmers in Aravalli district.",2021

Scholars argue that food policy integration – policies that unite numerous food-related actions – is required to overcome dominant siloed and fragmented approaches and to tackle environmental and economic crises. However, what is being integrated and how such integrations contribute to food system transformation remain unexplored. This paper aims to disentangle frames and approaches to food policy integration through a critical analysis of literature on integrated policies and food system transformation. Complemented by a systematic literature review for “food system” and “polic* integrat*”, overlapping approaches and gaps between these literatures are revealed over the last twenty years. We use the prisms of processes (“how” food policy integration is being practiced), placement (“where” crossovers between sectors in governance institutions and where synergies between objectives can be created) and things (“what” specific aspects of the food system and related sectors exist within integrated policies and leverage points to trigger transformative dynamics) to explore how policy integration and food system transformation intersect within current debates. Our findings reveal cross-cutting themes and distinct theoretical frameworks but also identify substantial gaps, where frames of food policy integration often remain within their disciplinary silos, are ambiguous or ill-defined. We conclude that to achieve policy integration as a tool for food system transformation, a new research and policy agenda is needed that builds on diverse knowledges, critical policy approaches and the integration of food with other sectors.",2024

NFTs, unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain network, bind various sources of health data to their owner (the patient) and delineate the access rights for stakeholders (providers, researchers) using smart contracts. Data sources may include electronic medical records from different hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, test centers, and mHealth devices. Accordingly, patients and their providers benefit from seamless visibility of diagnoses, medications, electrocardiograms, imaging, home blood pressure logs, and artificial intelligence-enabled insights from these aggregated data. Rather than being stored on proprietary servers, data are encrypted and stored on decentralized networks with a unified point of access and immutable proof of ownership, making them more robust to theft or tampering. As custodians of their NFT, patients are incentivized to actively partake in their health monitoring and self-driven research that aligns with their needs using innovative marketplaces that allow them to browse studies, document their informed consent, and monetize their contributions. Furthermore, they are empowered to educate themselves and seek care across siloes in traditional settings or virtual platforms such as the metaverse, where NFTs serves as digital passports.

They have enormous socioeconomic, ecological, and traditional roles in the community. We address bamboo plantations and their distribution, identify factors influencing bamboo planting and marketing, and assess the role of bamboo for smallholder farmers and customers in Ethiopia. We also examine planting and management practices, governance, and challenges and opportunities for bamboo production and marketing. The decisions to plant bamboo are influenced by many demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as age, educational status, family size, income, farm size, land scarcity, bamboo culm price, and market information. They are also influenced by institutional factors, including market distance, marketing linkages, access to markets, tenure security, and psychological factors such as the perception of risk and attitude towards bamboo production. Bamboo plays a variety of socio-economic, ecological, and traditional roles in the community. It is one of the essential components of agricultural tasks and practices for most households and provides considerable cash income. For instance, it provides material for house and fence construction, furniture, wood fuel, and musical instruments. It is used as a source of food, medicine, and fodder and also for soil and water conservation, biodiversity functioning, and mitigating global climate change, as well as an alternative source of timber and non-timber products for rural and urban people, forest industries, construction, and energy sectors.

Methodologically, this paper conceptually reviews antecedents of and draws on a structured search and scoping review of the two popular but disjointed literatures on ID and Mission-Oriented Innovation (MOI). Drawing on an analysis of 99 journal articles, this paper seeks to provide a better understanding about differences and common grounds of the two strands of literature. Five analytical categories are developed and applied to assess and interpret insights from existing publications: (1) understandings, definitions, and objectives; (2) theoretical-conceptual underpinnings; (3) analytical and methodological approaches; (4) evaluation; and (5) governance. We find that there is ample opportunity for cross-fertilization of insights across these two literatures. Based on this in-depth analysis, the contours of a new concept of MOID are outlined through a formal definition of MOID and insights from the analysis are translated into future research questions to inform a transformative agenda for innovation policy.",2023

The purpose of this study is to discuss how enhancing the role of local institutions (LI) and incorporating indigenous knowledge (IK) in climate change adaptation planning can improve adoption and scaling success of climate-smart agriculture innovations.
Design/methodology/approach
A review of relevant literature from sub-Saharan Africa was used to answer the study research questions.
Findings
Embracing IK and LI in climate change adaptation projects can enhance adoption and scaling success of climate-smart agriculture innovations in smallholder farming. Such efforts will improve: information gathering and dissemination, mobilization of resources, establishment of useful networks with relevant stakeholders, capacity building farmers on various fronts and provision of leadership in climate adaptation programs.
Practical implications
Fully embracing IK and LI can improve the scaling of climate-smart innovations only if development partners recognize IK systems that are to be transformed and build on them instead of trying to replace them. Also, participatory approaches in scaling innovations will enhance input from rural people in climate change adaptation programs.
Originality/value
Development interventions aimed at taking proven effective climate-smart innovations to scale must, therefore, engage local communities and their indigenous institutions as active stakeholders in designing, planning and implementation of their climate adaptation programs.",2020

Ranging in age, size, location and complexity, these projects have faced a series of technical, social and economic challenges, with varying degrees of success. This paper presents the results of a systematic, state-of-the-art literature review with the aim of identifying the main technical barriers experienced by SLES in the UK. Originality is provided in the discussion of the key barrier areas identified during the review, which include those posed by multi-vector integration, grid connection, energy storage, smart technology and electric vehicles. The site-specific nature of SLES is identified as limiting the applicability of specific technical barriers, as is the need to view technical barriers within their respective social, economic and regulatory contexts. From the findings emerge three fundamental underlying technical challenges which face all SLES: diversity, uncertainty and integration. The findings also indicate that a more detailed understanding of site and context-specific barriers – and the relationships between them – is required in order to facilitate the mitigation or removal of technical barriers to the upscaling of SLES.",2020

Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendations related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.",2020

This digital transformation is also characterised by a change of paradigm, based on moving from computer-aided technologies to Smart Systems, which are present in several domains such as Smart Cities, Smart Manufacturing, or Smart Services. In this scenario, the exploration of the conceptualisation of Smart Systems has been addressed in the scientific literature with the objective to understand the characteristics of such systems and the implications of their use. However, there is a lack of a generic view of the concept since most studies focus on specific domains. This view is necessary to provide common ground for the development or implementation of Smart Systems within various domains, specially for those that have not been tackled yet. This work aims at addressing this issue through the exploration and analysis of conceptualisations of Smart Systems and Smartness within the scientific literature. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review is performed aiming at gathering papers including definitions of Smart Systems, regardless of the application domain. Text mining processing techniques are applied to obtain insights from the definitions extracted from the collected papers.

Canadian forests and the forest sector remain vital pillars of the Canadian economy and home to many rural and remote communities. However, climate change is an existential threat to the sustainability of forests and forest-dependent communities. While both direct and indirect threats posed by climate change to Canada's forest sector are now well understood, our understanding of specific forest practices that have emerged from the body of science to mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts is not well documented. Through a review of the scientific and grey literature, this study expands our knowledge and operational gaps associated with implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation practices in Canadian forests. The study found a dearth of literature specifically dedicated to reporting on the type of forest practices currently in use across Canada to address mitigation and adaptation. Most reports or studies were published in 2019 or later, with federal and provincial governments being the dominant actors in reporting and monitoring, research, and funding. Across the 15 terrestrial ecozones in Canada, forest practices linked to climate change were reported in 12 ecozones, with most practices reported in the Montane Cordillera located in western Canada. Common forest practices reported include fuel management, assisted migration, enhanced silvicultural activities, and carbon offset projects. We conclude that climate change adaptation/mitigation practices in Canada are in their early stages of implementation. Many practices remain in experimental stages (e.g., genetic trials) or are implemented at a relatively small scale in Canada (e.g., climate-based seed transfer and carbon reserves). The literature suggests that the most mainstream practices associated with climate change mitigation in Canada include tree planting for carbon sequestration and the designation of protected areas to enhance ecosystem resilience. We conclude that despite increasing reports linking climate change benefits with reported forest practices, the reporting in the scientific literature is scarce, poorly reported, and often not grounded in credible evidence.",2023

CSAF is a new name for an old farming practice among the world’s traditional farmers, a holistic approach to land use in which trees, crops, and sometimes animals are combined within a managed farmland, a sustainable farming system and practice, and a pathway toward the mitigation and adaptation of the biggest challenge of our times: climate change. CSAF systems and practices provide a range of goods and services vital for human well-being, particularly for people who live below the poverty line. Yet a number of important knowledge, research, and adoption gaps remain regarding human-environment interactions, and the urgency behind these gaps reflects the need to inform evidence-based policymaking and practice to realize the potential for CSAF to support farmers' livelihoods. We conducted a review of CSAF system practices that contribute to achieving the SDGs, in particular those related to increased human well-being, and prosperity, soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change response, biodiversity conservation, and landscape management, from the SDGs outlook. The study specifically identifies, (i) what has been innovatively achieved in CSAF practices to cope with climate risks for environmental stability, improved farm productivity, farm income, and food security (what works), (ii) challenges facing smallholder farmers to adopt CSAF practices (what doesn’t work), and (iii) room for a significant contribution of CSAF practices in smallholder farmers' productivity beyond what has been observed. Generally, the results show that CSAF practices have the potential to optimize different socio-economic returns and sustain environmental services. Farming with CSAF technologies has many advantages in both ecological and economic aspects that support the achievement of several of the SDGs, specifically SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG5 (gender equality), SDG6 (clean water and proper sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG13 (climate action), and SDG15 (life on land). Results showed that despite its contribution to the SDGs and its global widespread, the challenge remains linking knowledge and action in CSAF research, education, and capacity development. Farmers will not be able to solve the challenge of sustainable agriculture by themselves. Thus, efforts are required from both the public and the industry and effective public-private partnerships along the agricultural and food value chain. There are multidimensional aspects to CSAF which require in-depth scientific analysis for the extensive application of CSAF practices in sustainable land management endeavors. Moreover, in this perspective, CSAF should keep its identity while seeking a role in the nexus of SDGs. We hope this review will provide a clearer picture of what the state-of-the-art in practicing smarter technologies in a changing climate is and provide a more holistic understanding of CSAF systems and practices, and the gaps regarding human-environment interactions, and the way forward to overcoming them.",2023

They provide a measurable third-party approach to ensuring sustainability design and directives are met through the use of indictors, criteria’s and credit system. A key challenge is that the existing tools such as BREEAM Communities and LEED Neighbourhood Development address a wider community but cannot efficiently address the more nuanced and context specific sustainability requirements of campuses. However, the approach of utilizing credits, indicator and criteria systems is a tactic that campus planners have slowly began to imbibe. This is even more critical to sustainable development cities due to the huge amounts of land and human resources consumed on campuses; However, gaps exist within the currently existing Campus Sustainability Assessment Tools (CSAT) that have been developed. Generally. Though studies have identified trends and gaps in neighbourhood and building assessment tools, no comprehensive study has investigated the potential gaps from the newly emerging CSATs. Using bibliometric analysis, this study reviews over 1000 articles on campus sustainability and assessment tools with the aim of determining the gaps, trends and focus area of campus sustainability via CSAT. The result draw out 15 dimensions that govern the design of sustainable campuses, and the most predominant dimensions were environmental, educational and governance dimension. The results also highlight the importance of context in implementing and developing CSATs and showed numerous overlooked campus sustainability issues, which have considerable impact on the determining the claims that makes campuses sustainable. Finally, results demonstrated a need to enhance inclusivity in decision making on campus via different survey techniques in both education and implementation of campus sustainability initiatives.

The results indicate that smart homes enhance the comfort of the dwellers, ensure the diversification of energy sources and use, promote inclusiveness in the provision of housing and present an avenue for environmental cleanliness. Based on these benefits, and in an era of sustainable cities, the authorities of the cities in North America and Europe are encouraging the adoption of smart homes by urbanites. However, there is insufficient data to assess the level of adoption of smart housing in SSA although anecdotally the rate of adoption may be low. This is partly attributed to the region’s low levels of literacy, income and technological penetration.

However, when such synergies exist, the situation of small-scale farmers is often overlooked, and they are unable to implement new practices and technologies. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to improve CSA by adding the neglected but very important element “small-scale farmer”, and introduce Vulnerable-Smart Agriculture (VSA) as a complete version of CSA. VSA indicates, based on the results of this study, that none of the decisions made by policymakers can be realistic and functional as long as the voice of the farmers influenced by their decisions is not heard. Therefore, to identify different levels for possible interventions and develop VSA monitoring indicators, a new conceptual framework needs to be developed.

Since smart city initiatives are citizen-focused, public administrators must have strategies and plans for promoting citizenship as well as understanding how citizens use smart city technologies to develop sustainable smart city efforts. However, current knowledge of development and use issues relating to 311 system is limited. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence 311 system user behaviors with respect to the creation of citizen-generated data to help improve the management of citizen relationships. The results demonstrated that individual differences were viewed as a catalyst for user behaviors and have both a direct and indirect influence on such behaviors. These differences in views, along with technology acceptance theory and citizen-initiated contact theory, all emphasize the factors influencing citizen behaviors in 311 citizen-initiated contact and 311 contact channel choices. In addition, technology acceptance, satisfaction with the neighborhood environment, and frequent use of public services are characteristics exhibited by those who use 311 system more frequently. Significant evidence regarding the causal relationship between these three variables shows that 311 system is both service consumer-oriented and user-oriented and, as a result, reduces the gap between supply side and demand side in the adoption of governmental ICTs, which is viewed as a daunting challenge in the study of governmental ICTs and digital governance.",2020

The paper begins by discussing the carbon impact of the sector and the concept of ‘smart campuses' applied to the sector in the context of decarbonisation. Opportunities and challenges associated with integrating smart energy systems at the university campus from a policy and technical perspective are then discussed. This is followed by a review of building and campus-scale frameworks supporting a transition to smart energy campuses using the BPIE’ Smart Buildings' framework. The paper finds that the complexity of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for new and existing higher education buildings and energy systems can be addressed with the adoption of ‘smart building principles' and integrating 'smartness' into their energy systems. Several universities in the UK and worldwide are integrating smart services and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their operations following the smart campus premise. At the building level, existing frameworks often create conceptual roadmaps for the smart building premise or propose technical implementation and assessment methods. At university campus scale, implementation typically comes through single-vector interventions, and only few examples exist that propose a multi-vector approach. Comparisons of the drivers and the decision-making process are made, with carbon and cost reduction being the most prominent from leveraging distributed energy generation.

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies.

The purpose of this paper was to study a better grid system optimization scheme, and an improved mixed integer linear algorithm was proposed. And based on this algorithm, the multi-energy power grid system of a smart stadium was optimized, and at the same time, the common particle swarm algorithm was used to optimize the power grid system to compare the effects. The experimental results showed that the total monthly power supply cost of the optimized power grid system based on the improved mixed integer linear algorithm was 2061.2 yuan, the maximum pollution reduction was 17.3%, and the power supply system working time was reduced by 4.2% on average. The total monthly power supply cost of the optimized power grid system based on particle swarm algorithm was 2126.1 yuan, the highest pollution reduction was 12.6%, and the power supply system working time was reduced by 5.7% on average. In contrast, it can be seen that compared with the optimization of particle swarm optimization, the optimized multi-energy grid system of smart stadiums based on the improved mixed integer linear algorithm reduces more power supply costs, increases the stability of power supply power, and reduces more pollution emissions, but it is not effective in reducing system working time.",2022

These changes have spawned new challenges in the way with which the power grid should be managed. As a result, the development of new modelling approaches, as well as management techniques deemed “smart”, is called for to better monitor and control this increasingly complex system by taking into account the specificities of distributed generators (DGs) and their impact on the grid. This paper explores the evolution of power grids into “smart grids” in the light of the penetration of distributed generation and the features that ensue. Then, it gives an overview of notable works in the literature aimed at the modelling and control of power grids within this framework. The reader is provided with an in-depth analysis of a variety of methods through the lens of the applications for which they are most suited. Though well-established methods that have been in use for infrastructure planning for decades, such as optimal power flow (OPF), remain reliable tools, cutting-edge research in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS) opens the door to putting a myriad of complex numerical algorithms in the service of power grid monitoring and control.

Recently, in science and policy circles, there has been a growing interest in the concept of Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) resilience which offers a new interpretation. While this concept is now used frequently, it is not properly understood and there is still a lack of clarity on what it means and its underpinning principles. This lack of clarity and understanding may confuse and even disorient researchers and policy makers. To address this issue, we review the literature published in the context of urban systems. The reviewed literature is mainly focused on nature-based solutions, indicating more contributions from the ecological field. Also, flooding, extreme heat, and drought are major stressors discussed in the literature. We elaborate on the definition of SETS resilience and discuss that its dominant principles are adaptability, transformability, flexibility, redundancy, equity, diversity, foresight capacity, connectivity, robustness, multi-functionality, learning, and non-linearity. We also expound upon the key components of SETS, how they are intertwined, and potential trade-offs that may emerge between them. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of the SETS approach leads to numerous ancillary benefits. These include benefits for climate change adaptation and mitigation, pandemic prevention and response, human health and well-being, and justice. If multi-level and polycentric governance strategies are adopted, it can also help avoid trade-offs that may emerge between social, ecological, and technological dimensions. We conclude by emphasizing that the literature is dominated by epistemological approaches and more empirical research is needed to understand better the complex dynamics of SETS resilience.",2023

We show that, so far, overall levels of BPI are low, reflected in too abstract targets, add-on biodiversity policies not targeting the driving forces of biodiversity loss, and insufficient resources made available to pursue biodiversity recovery. Joint planning processes, the revision of policies for consistent and coherent incentives, and adaptive learning are identified as central factors for improving BPI, but considerable barriers in these areas undermine progress in BPI.

A systematic literature review on inter- and transnational collaborative governance of the textile and clothing industry,,"Since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, partnerships between actors from different sectors and countries have been joining forces to tackle major sustainability challenges. Within the textile and clothing industry, inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships have worked to address labor rights violations and environmentally harmful modes of production. Although research on these networks and partnerships has been increasing, it has remained heterogeneous. It derives from many different disciplines and research communities, leaving behind an opaque field of literature. This article provides a critical overview and a comprehensive understanding of research on inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships of the textile and clothing industry through a systematic literature review. It analyzes 301 academic peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2018. It uses quantitative full-text bibliometric word analysis, followed by coding around the meta-framework of modes of governance, which provides an integrative framework for this field of study. Firstly, this analysis revealed four discourses referred to as Economic and Industrial Development, Ecology and Environment, Private Labor Governance and Workers’ Rights, and Critical Ethnographies. Secondly, these four discourses were found to differ in their thematic sustainability challenges as well as in their variety of governance modes and partnerships. Research on economic sustainability tends to focus on modes of central and public-private governance; research on environmental challenges focus more on private governance of supply networks and; research on social sustainability tends to focus on more participatory, interactive and self-governing modes between multiple actors. The analysis provides a unique classification of scientific articles through modes of governance, which is helpful in positioning research in the debate, analyzing and comparing approaches and thus highlighting current gaps and opportunities for future research. The results indicate that both inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration is needed to address the identified dialectical and practical challenges, including increased involvement of research as a key actor in knowledge creation for governance and sustainability transformation within the textile and clothing industry.",2020

Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework.

Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.",2021

Digital twins (DTs) could revolutionize the EAM paradigm by bidirectionally linking the physical and digital worlds in real time. There is great industrial and academic interest in DTs for EAM. However, previous review studies have predominately focused on technical aspects using limited life-cycle perspectives, failing to holistically synthesize DTs for EAM from the managerial point of view. Based on a systematic literature review, we introduce an analytical framework for describing DTs for EAM, which encompasses three levels or categories: DT 1.0 for technical EAM, DT 2.0 for technical−human EAM, and DT 3.0 for technical−environmental EAM. Using this framework, we identify what is known, what is unknown, and future directions at each level. DT 1.0 addresses issues of asset quality, progress, and cost management, generating technical value. It lacks multi-objective self-adaptive EAM, however, and suffers from high application cost. It is imperative to enable closed-loop EAM in order to provide various functional services with affordable DT 1.0. DT 2.0 accommodates issues of human−machine symbiosis, safety, and flexibility management, generating managerial value beyond the technical performance improvement of engineering assets. However, DT 2.0 currently lacks the automation and security of human−machine interactions and the managerial value related to humans is not prominent enough in it. Future research needs to align technical and managerial value with highly automated and secure DT 2.0. DT 3.0 covers issues of participatory governance, organization management, sustainable development, and resilience enhancement, generating macro social value. Yet it suffers from organizational fragmentation and can only address limited social governance issues. Numerous research opportunities exist to coordinate different stakeholders. Similarly, future research opportunities exist to develop DT 3.0 in a more open and complex system.",2024

These are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change, leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society, environment, and economy. The cross-sector Internet of Things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective, cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards. However, despite growing prominence within research, this technology remains under-utilised, in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology, obscuring the strategic co-ordination of research. We respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology, practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape, as well as identifying key research gaps for future development. We find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is, or will be, beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management, although this has not yet transferred to water quality. However, research is dominated by proof-of-concept modelling studies, with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets, individual pilot studies and monitoring. We recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated, decentralised, and optimised catchment-scale approach.",2022

The employment of internet of things (IoT) technologies has proven to be a valid response to mobility challenges in rural areas, and has brought up the concept of “smart land”. Framed within the context of the Interreg Central Europe project RUMOBIL, this study tries to shed light on how the deployment of smart mobility solutions within the rural context compare to that within the urban context. Following a literature review, we compared the ease of implementation of different IoT solutions on the urban and the rural contexts, for planners, travellers, and operators, and the relative complexity of common smart mobility issues. In addition, we identified three major challenges for both rural and urban mobility, namely the need for standardized metrics for optimal routes' detection and a dynamic definition of optimal route, as well as the simplification of investments' planning and programming. Both smart cities and smart land can benefit from smart mobility solutions, even if in most cases, each of the two contexts can gain more advantages than the other from the same solution. Even considering the different levels of population scattering, technological infrastructures, social maturity, and economic opportunities, both rural and urban areas offer comparable advantages. For the future of transport, it is up to all policy levels to consider the challenges deriving from expected trends and leverage the untapped potential of IoT technologies to satisfy future travellers’ needs and ensure sustainability.",2020

As BCT grows, organizations aim to automate their processes and engage in business collaborations using SCs. The translation of contract semantics into SC language semantics is difficult due to ambiguous contractual interpretation by the several parties and the developers. Also, an SC language itself misses the language constructs needed for semantically expressing collaboration terms. This leads to SC coding errors that result in contractual conflicts over transactions during the performance of SCs and thus, novel SC solutions incur high development and maintenance costs. Various model-based and no/low code development approaches address this issue by enabling higher abstractions in SC development. Still, the question remains unanswered how contractual parties, i.e., end-users with non-IT skills, manage to develop legally relevant SCs with ease. This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the state of the art of SC automation models, in terms of their technical features, and their legal significance, and to (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a systematic literature review (SLR) that follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham for performing SLRs in software-engineering. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 1367 papers are collected, and 33 of them are selected for extraction and analysis. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) 10 different SC automation models/frameworks are identified and classified according to their technical and implementation features; (2) 11 different legal contract parameters are identified and categorized into 4 legal criteria classes; (3) a comparative analysis of SC-automation models in the context of their legal significance is conducted that identifies the degrees to which the SC-automation models are considered legally relevant. As a conclusion, we produce a comprehensive and replicable overview of the state of the art of SC automation models and a systematic measure of their legal significance to benefit practitioners in the field.",2022

Hence, other determinants of implementation should be considered. Yet, the existing scant literature has never addressed this phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to provide insights about determinants of port decarbonisation implementation. The implementation theory (ImpThry) lens and port decarbonisation literature were reviewed and then both bodies of literature were cross analysed to demonstrate the applicability of ImpThry to port decarbonisation and identify determinants of successful implementation. Results have presented six constructs, i.e., implementation schemes, level of governance, interorganisational relationships, disposition and commitment of managers, capacities and economic conditions, and engagement with target groups, as determinants of port decarbonisations. Additionally, measurement items were identified, and several hypotheses were proposed. While the results presented a new conceptualisation based on ImpThry and paved the way of empirical investigation in future research, it also has managerial implications. The various demonstrated determinants inspire and direct the attention of port business managers and decision-makers to implementation pathways to achieve the decarbonation goal. Also, determinants draw attention to why port decarbonisation implementation succeeds or fails. While this is the first study that addresses this topic, it is considered as an extended application of the ImpThry in port decarbonisation. Nonetheless, the findings from this research make a desirable contribution to smooth port decarbonisation implementation.",2024

The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes, and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies, inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry; and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls for a holistic application of this ‘new’ paradigm and refrain from cherry-picking ‘cheap and easy’ technologies and applications; and suggests that the construction industry may be able to leapfrog the ‘4.0’ revolution and directly embrace a ‘5.0’ approach by incorporating a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.",2023

Methods:
We analyzed 112 papers collected from different online sources, both from the academic field and from websites and blogs ranging from 2004 till mid-2022.
Results:
(a) There is no one single bullet-proof solution available for the protection of public spaces. (b) From our analysis we found three major active fields for the protection of public spaces: Information Technologies, Architectural approaches, Organizational field. (c) While the academic suggest best practices and methodologies for the protection of urban areas, the market did not provide any type of implementation of such suggested approaches, which shows a lack of fertilization between academia and industry.
Conclusion:
The overall analysis has led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely, multiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and security in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to rethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in continuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.",2023

A more balanced narrative can trigger action for a productive Sahel and can be based on innovative approaches and a conducive policy environment to value natural resources. Despite a rich set of information, the potential of the Sahel is still not flagged with sound knowledge that can be opposed to the conspicuous depressed perception. Positive transformation pathways require many improvements in the governance, finance and equity issues with a particular reference to the youth and women. The Sahel can sustain its sustainable development if transformation occurs in natural resources management.

In recent years, agricultural industrialization has caused the loss of some important ecosystem services in agroecosystems, hindering some sustainable development goals (SDGs). In order to promote sustainable agricultural development, it is necessary to restore the damaged agroecosystems and improve agroecosystem services (AES). However, there are relatively few studies on AES, and fewer studies concerning the definition or connotation of AES. Therefore, this paper reviews current AES research, indicators, and assessment methods, as well as directions for future research. AES are determined by agroecosystem functions and human agricultural practices, with both positive and negative effects, scale effects, and trade-offs and synergies between AES. AES indicators can be classified as provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services, with a few studies including supporting services. Currently, the main AES assessment methods include public participation, empirical model, mechanism model, and value estimation. Multi-source data fusion for integrated models to assess multiple AES will be the future research trend. In addition, AES research should develop additional promising topics, including considering both AES and agroecosystem disservices (AEDS); assessing AES supply, demand, and flow; and analyzing AES trade-offs and synergies comprehensively. This will extend the research field to the links between AES and SDGs and their applications in agricultural landscape planning and governance. This review highlights the importance of AES research to more effectively manage agroecosystems and promote sustainable agricultural development.",2022

These persistent anomalous warming events can have severe ecological and socioeconomic impacts, threatening ecologically and economically vital organisms such as bivalves and the ecosystems they support. Developing robust environmental and social frameworks to enhance the resilience and adaptability of bivalve aquaculture is critical to ensuring the sustainability of this crucial food source. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the physiological and ecological impacts of MHWs on commercially important bivalve species farmed globally. We propose an integrated risk assessment framework that encompasses environmental monitoring, farm-level preparedness planning, and community-level social support systems to safeguard bivalve aquaculture. Specifically, we examine heatwave prediction models, local mitigation strategies, and social programs that could mitigate the impacts on bivalve farms and vulnerable coastal communities economically dependent on this fishery. At the farm level, adaptation strategies such as selective breeding for heat-tolerant strains, optimized site selection, and adjustments to culture practices can improve survival outcomes during MHWs. Robust disease surveillance and management programs are essential for early detection and rapid response. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement, knowledge exchange, and collaborative governance in developing context-specific, inclusive, and equitable safeguard systems. Proactive measures, such as advanced forecasting tools like the California Current Marine Heat Wave Tracker developed by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, enable preemptive action before losses occur. Coordinated preparation and response, underpinned by continuous monitoring and adaptive management, promise to protect these climate-vulnerable food systems and coastal communities. However, sustained research, innovation, and cross-sector collaboration are imperative to navigate the challenges posed by our rapidly changing oceans.",2024

It has become an important theme of recent scientific and policy work. Despite the myriads positive impacts of restoration practices in developing countries, there are also numbers of socio-economic, technical, as well as governance limitations that need to be addressed innovatively. This research synthesizes the top-ten limitations that indicate inadequacy of the existing water resources management practices to enhance ecosystem sustainability potential. In parallel, the research advocates and demonstrates the pressing need of ecohydrology as a scientific paradigm. The identified limitations comprise: (1) underutilized role of dual regulation between ‘biota and hydrology’; (2) the significant size of scarce productive lands that are forced to be out of production due to sizes of the physical land management technologies; (3) tendencies to over-engineer the environment; (4) less focus on water and nutrient cycle regulation; (5) tendency of considering the biological measures as a mere stabilizers of the physical measures instead of its opportunity for dual regulation (which is one of the ecohydrologic principles); (6) failure to target multiple ecosystem services as outcomes; (7) failure to provide immediate benefits to the farmers; (8) recommending passive restoration of extremely degraded landscapes which actually need ecologically assisted; (9) the need of climate-smartness of landscape restoration practices; and (10) tendency to be sectoral instead of systemically operating. The research also demonstrated that ecohydrologic strategy can address these gaps through its low-cost and high-impact practices.",2021

However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include ‘smart packaging’ that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.",2021

Governments and AI scholarship have endorsed key AI principles but lack direction at the implementation level. Through a systematic literature review of 59 papers, this paper contributes to the critical debate on the ethical use of AI in DTs beyond high-level AI principles. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that identifies 14 digital ethics implications for the use of AI in seven DT archetypes using a novel ontological framework (physical, cognitive, information, and governance). The paper presents key findings of the review and a conceptual model with twelve propositions highlighting the impact of digital ethics implications on societal impact, as moderated by DT archetypes and mediated by organisational impact. The implications of intelligibility, accountability, fairness, and autonomy (under the cognitive domain), and privacy (under the information domain) are the most widely discussed in our sample. Furthermore, ethical implications related to the governance domain are shown to be generally applicable for most DT archetypes. Implications under the physical domain are less prominent when it comes to AI diffusion with one exception (safety). The key findings and resulting conceptual model have academic and professional implications.",2022

An emerging disruptive solution with high potential for improved sustainability is using drones as a mode of transport, i.e., Advanced Air Mobility for passenger and freight transport in urban and rural areas,fuelled by electricity or green hydrogen. As drones are being rapidly commercialized, there is a need for a policy framework for local and regional actors to address this in decision-making. This paper aims to develop a policy framework through a systematic literature review where findings have been validated by experts from industry and appropriate governance bodies. The results reveal three conceptual elements in the Advanced Air Mobility system where policy actions are needed: 1) primary technology, including vehicle-related aspects; 2) functionality, including infrastructure and operations; and 3) adoption, including the environment, market, and society. The overall lack of a multi-level governance model for Advanced Air Mobility and the scarcity of knowledge of the topic within vital fields such as energy systems and regional planning are also addressed. The findings are discussed in light of regulatory frameworks for drone transportation in Europe. The paper concludes with a policy development framework for regional Advanced Air Mobility deployment and provides policy implications.",2023

Yet, translating these words into tangible action and institutionalizing mitigation efforts remains a key challenge in post-Paris climate governance. This is particularly prevalent in the Global South, where carbon emissions are expected to grow most significantly over the next decades. Besides, efforts to tackle the climate crisis compete with other human development priorities. With this review, we explore the prospects and challenges of institutionalizing climate change mitigation in the Global South. We (1) map the field in terms of concepts, methods, regions, sectors, and topics; (2) suggest a differentiation between reform-oriented, transformative, and failed attempts to institutionalize climate change mitigation, and (3) propose a future research agenda. We conclude that a stronger emphasis on institutionalization as a political, societal, and discursive challenge is crucial for implementing, sustaining, and enhancing climate change mitigation in the Global South.",2023

Conflict and climate change might be present in the same areas and expose communities that struggle with these dual risks, but they do not co-occur in consistent or predictable ways. We question how to effectively adapt to climate change in areas experiencing violence. Conflict can make adaptation to climate change more difficult, but when local conflict patterns are better understood it is possible to introduce climate adaptation measures that are effective and responsive to the needs of the population. Further, we argue that conflict mitigation is not a climate adaptation. Even in conflict zones, the most effective climate adaptations focus on climate-centred technical solutions and poverty reduction, local governance legitimacy, and community-led efforts to cooperate in periods of climate stress. We outline some of these possibilities.",2024
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2024.101320,,"Energy transition: Connotations, mechanisms and effects","Energy transition, Renewable energy, Just transition, Energy security","Currently, the research agenda of energy transition is gaining momentum. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of this body of research by presenting a framework that describes the connotations, mechanisms, and effects of energy transitions. The study concludes that the energy transition will lead to the reconstruction of energy system elements beyond the energy sector, with the dual connotations of explicit transition and implicit transition. The explicit transition is usually captured by statistic data and information, for instance, energy utilization type, structure, form, transportation mode, and spatial pattern. The implicit transition involves shifts in energy security, geopolitical structure, energy power, energy justice, and energy governance, which receives relatively less attention in current literature. The energy transition is a highly socialized process, driven by many intertwined factors such as technological innovation, market mechanisms, policy arrangements, and sociocultural factors, triggering profound socio-economic and ecological effects. Looking ahead, it is urgent to pay attention to the multi-scale effects of energy transition, avoid the risks brought by energy transition, and ultimately achieve just energy transition. This paper provides a novel perspective and contributes to the literature on theoretical understanding and advancement of energy transition.",2024

This suggests that detrimental social practices need to be fundamentally changed. While social innovation is one possible approach for such change, a comprehensive picture of research on social innovation in relation to ecological challenges is missing. Therefore, with an emphasis on so-called strong sustainability, this article's purpose was to investigate social innovation's potential in relation to ecological crises, to identify important gaps, and advance research implications. A systematic literature review of social innovation research that address environmental issues was carried out, and the resulting literature was analyzed according to sustainability and five dimensions of social innovation. To reap more of social innovation's potential in our time of ecological crises, we suggest a move in social innovation research towards strong sustainability and propose such research avenues within each of the five dimensions of social innovation: conceptualization, environmental needs and challenges, key resources, capabilities, and constraints, types of governance, networks and actors, and, finally, process dynamics for strongly sustainable social innovation.",2021

This paper presents a narrative synthesis of existing knowledge to connect, unveil and comprehensively overview politics, ppace and PoS. Using a qualitative exploratory approach, the study data from eighty-nine secondary sources guided by six topical search themes. With over 85% of the secondary sources spanning from 2000 to 2022, the review suggests that politics and space are diverse and multidisciplinary concepts, while space and political philosophies, as well as human systems, cocreate PoS. The analysis indicates that PoS is context-responsive, yet no clear definition exists. Reflections on the PoS are qualitative, and there is a general lack of the application of mixed methods in its investigation. Remarkably, themes like inequality, control, discrimination, suppression, exclusion and words of similar meanings are characteristics of PoS research. Human-constructed systems like cultural, market, management and governance structures drive the themes. Hence, within the complexities of politics and space, humans and systems construct and reconstruct the PoS as social and political actors envision. The multi-varied nature of politics and space should lead to the application of mixed methods in future studies on PoS. Also, PoS could benefit from a cross-continent perspective using the different social contexts and systems to help gather holistic knowledge towards conceptualisation.",2023

This paper uses an organized search strategy for reviewing the most impactful previous studies regarding decarbonisations strategies in UCs in different climate contexts. This research presents a comprehensive overview of influential parameters, which are practical to be considered in designing new or retrofitting existing UCs which has not been done before and also highlights relevant policies and guidelines required to implement these parameters. These factors are spatial planning and landscape, renewable and clean energy, energy systems, thermal envelope, green transportation, management and control, human-related performance and smartness. This review also explores the recent trends in the decarbonisation of UCs such as the application of smart technologies and implementation of real-time data-based control and management technologies. Finally, this review presents the research gaps, future trends and technologies which will facilitate the decarbonisation of UCs.

However, the way BEs are – and need to be – driven by policy to reach cities’ circular goals is still an under-researched aspect. Particularly, there is limited knowledge of policy instruments aimed to foster the transition towards a circular built environment. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature search and a review of scientific publications to characterize the relation between the circular built environment and policy instruments suggesting its implementation from a circular city development perspective. We do so by answering: (1) how many publications elaborate on CBE policy instruments, (2) what type of circular actions in relation to circular city development are mentioned, and (3) what policy instruments are proposed to implement a CBE. The literature search is performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our results show that 53% of publications address policies instruments for circular built environment transitions. Although different circular actions are identified, looping actions prevail. Adapting and ecologically-regenerating actions, which are essential for circular city development, remain insufficiently researched. Finally, among policy instruments for circular built environment implementation there is a clear tendency towards regulation as means for leverage, which calls for bigger research efforts concerning the mix of policy instruments, as well as in more general challenges in governance and policy coherence.",2022

Leveraging digitalization, in the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design, construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends, challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible, energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real-time data collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30%–50% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040. While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer awareness and a skilled workforce.

While there is now an extensive body of literature describing expected climate change impacts and potential responses, studies characterizing the implementation of adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management remain rare in the Canadian forest sector. Using a systematic literature review, we examined reports on forest management practices implemented in response to climate change, specifically focusing on governance and institutional arrangements that either support or limit climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Our literature sample size of 24 documents suggests that the body of literature reporting on adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management is scarce. Governments remain the dominant actors providing funding and leading the implementation and reporting of climate change adaptation practices, primarily in response to national or international climate change commitments. Forest practices such as enhanced silviculture, assisted migration, and nature-based solutions were the most frequently reported. However, given the scarcity of literature, it is difficult to conclude the scope of climate change adaptation practice uptake in Canada. Barriers such as lack of information/data, inter-jurisdictional knowledge transfer, policy conflicts, forest tenure models, technical capacity gaps, and economic barriers to adaptation need to be overcome to strengthen climate change response in forest management.

ICOs represent an alternative and innovative financing solution that has experienced spectacular growth and notoriety in recent years. ICOs rely on Blockchain protocols and the ICO market is, therefore, characterized as decentralized, disintermediated and unregulated. Our results show that although the ICO market is innovative, it already displays many of the problems of traditional financial markets, and that these problems were at the genesis of the last financial crisis. Our analysis of the problems and solutions adopted shows a tension between what the Blockchain technology offers, and the problems associated with the financing of innovation. Considering the problems and solutions adopted, we no longer expect the ICO market to be characterized as disintermediated, unregulated or even decentralized in the near future. Furthermore, it is a real possibility that ICOs may end up being a progressor model eventually replaced by similar but more specialized financing models, some of which may already exist. With respect to the particular solutions of the ICO market, while some represent the realization of the potential of Blockchain, others such as forks have important Governance implications with the potential to create as many problems as the ones they address.",2022

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users’ privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened.",2021

Effective methods for managing, diagnosing, and lessening the effects of COVID-19 are critical because, by 2024, the virus has already caused over 7 million deaths. In this study, we anatomize the impacts of the latest COVID-19 virus on patients with the help of computational intelligence, like Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and IoT-enabled technologies for managing, analyzing, diagnosing, and predicting COVID-19. With tools for early identification, risk assessment, and therapy optimization, machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown tremendous promise in the healthcare industry. These tools can examine big datasets to find patterns and trends that might not be noticeable to human observers. Additionally, IoT will enable healthcare firms to monitor patient scenarios properly and reduce the readmission of COVID-19 patients. Wearable sensors and remote monitoring systems are two examples of IoT-enabled gadgets that are vital for tracking the COVID-19 virus's spread and keeping an eye on its sufferers.

The practice and assessment of sustainability implementation are greatly compounded by lack of funding, technical know-how, political will, and the power disparity between dominant institutions and marginalized communities. This systematic analysis of urban sustainability literature involved the review of 241 studies published between 2010 and 2022. We critically examined current debates and challenges in urban sustainability, identifying gaps and opportunities and providing recommendations for creating equitable, just, and sustainable urban futures. We also reviewed 23 studies to summarize the social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) indicators used to measure urban sustainability in the same period, many of which may not be relevant to the lived experiences of marginalized communities. To move toward more meaningful and equitable pathways, it is important to develop SETS indicators of urban sustainability that are reflective of the experiences and priorities of diverse groups in society. This review identifies four major issues in the current urban sustainability literature: space, scale, stakeholders, and dimension. These issues need to be centered in sustainability planning in order to develop solutions that are appropriate for the local context.",2023

These strategies are amplified by extreme meteorological events (e.g., droughts) that also trigger cognitive mechanisms, such as denial, opportunism or a kind of “myopic” competition to access the resource without considering (knowing) collateral impacts. From these environmental and social dimensions, this review first evaluates the arguments for the integration of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in socio-environmental observatories (SEO). SEO are structures concurrently monitoring natural, anthropogenic, and engineered processes but also relationships between stakeholders/managers and end-users. Second, in order to take advantage from the current private (and illegal) strategies, MAR implementation accompanied with a SEO structure is discussed to show how it promotes cognitive, social, economic, and governance conditions required for successful co-management.",2022

Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.",2023

We explore the extent to which private automobility will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared electric automated mobility regime that could effectively address societal sustainability challenges. We draw from the multi-level perspective of technological transition, develop a conceptual model outlining possible transition advancements towards private and shared electric automated mobility and review pertinent literature supporting such developments. Our analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). We conclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. Hence, the socioeconomic benefits of the so-called “three revolutions of automobility” could be diminished.",2024

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing in food supply chains. The ethical language associated with food supply and technology is contextualised and framed by the meaning given to it by stakeholders. Failure to differentiate between these nuanced meanings can create a barrier to technology adoption and reduce the benefit derived.
Scope and approach
The aim of this review paper is to consider the embedded ethical language used by stakeholders who collaborate in the adoption of AI in food supply chains. Ethical perspectives frame this literature review and provide structure to consider how to shape a common discourse to build trust in, and frame more considered utilisation of, AI in food supply chains to the benefit of users, and wider society.
Key findings and conclusions
Whilst the nature of data within the food system is much broader than the personal data covered by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ethical issues for computational and AI systems are similar and can be considered in terms of particular aspects: transparency, traceability, explainability, interpretability, accessibility, accountability and responsibility. The outputs of this research assist in giving a more rounded understanding of the language used, exploring the ethical interaction of aspects of AI used in food supply chains and also the management activities and actions that can be adopted to improve the applicability of AI technology, increase engagement and derive greater performance benefits. This work has implications for those developing AI governance protocols for the food supply chain as well as supply chain practitioners.",2022

Managing such a complex system sustainably relies on knowing what aspects can be managed, and conversely what aspects are outside the control of the manager. Accordingly, by taking elements from existing environmental management approaches, especially in Europe and Canada, here we propose an integrated systems analysis approach which links 14 component sub-systems. Using these cases shows that while all elements exist, they have hitherto not been combined into a holistic decision support system. These components are linked here in a cycle of three Parts - (A) defining the policy problems facing the seas, (B) obtaining the relevant and fit-for-purpose natural and social sciences data and information, and (C) creating an input for policy and decision-making which involves stakeholders. The component sub-systems are: an Underpinning Framework Sub-system (1), which then leads to the Issue Sub-system (2), which is vision-related and includes causes and/or consequences of pressures to be managed. The Ecological Sub-system (3) links the biota and its environment to the Socio-ecological Sub-system (4) and the Socio-economic subsystem (5), which considers the macroeconomic aspects. The Resources and Delivery Sub-system (6) considers which scientists do what and how do they do it and the Provenance Sub-system (7) checks that there is a fit-for-purpose and defendable science evidence base. The Governance Sub-system (8), incorporates policies and politics as well as horizontally and vertically integrating the Legislative (8A) and the Administrative Sub-systems (8B). The Communication (8C) and Stakeholder Sub-systems (8D) ensure involvement across the stakeholder typology (of formal and informal actors). Finally, the Achievement Sub-system (9) and the Feedback Sub-system (10) ensures that all of these actions achieve successful and sustainable marine resource management.",2020

A common characteristic of these ecosystems is their complex composition, which often involves the interaction of multiple actors. Currently, the notions of ""networking"", ""collaboration"", ""coordination"", and ""cooperation"", although having different meanings, are often loosely used to describe these interactions, which creates a sense of ambiguity and confusion. To better characterize the nature of interactions in current and emerging ecosystems, this article uses the systematic literature review method to analyse 34 emerging cases. The objective is threefold (a) to study the interactions and engagements between the involved actors, aiming at identifying elements of collaboration. (b) Identify the adopted technological enablers, and (c) ascertain how the composition and functions of these ecosystems compare to virtual power plants. The outcome revealed that the interactions between the members of these ecosystems can be described as cooperation and not necessarily as collaboration, except in a few cases. Regarding technological enablers, a vast panoply of technologies, such as IoT devices, smart meters, intelligent software agents, peer-to-peer networks, distributed ledger systems/blockchain technology (including smart contracts, blockchain as a platform service, and cryptocurrencies) were found. In comparison with virtual power plants, these ecosystems have similar composition, thus, having multiple actors, comprised of decentralized and heterogeneous technologies, and are formed by aggregating various distributed energy resources. They are also supported by ICT and are characterized by the simultaneous flow of information and energy.",2022

Indian forests not only accommodate the myriad species but also act as a survival support system to the communities that depended on them. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the United Nations (UN) has gained momentum and becomes an integral part of the recent efforts of Indian governance. In this investigation, we examined the potential nexus between Indian forestry system (biodiversity-enriched assets, ecosystem services, constitutional mechanisms, and governances) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through theoretical underpinnings from literature that selected from database like Google Scholar, Indian forest survey reports, and information retrieved from Indian government websites. The significance of this review is that it presents comprehensive information about Indian forestry, biodiversity-rich assets, and sustainable forest management practices. The results show that Indian forestry as a whole is an integral part of the food-energy-water cycle and contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The investigation confirms that besides partly contributing to the economy and life support systems to many dependent species, forests also act as boosters in the areas of food security and health.

This index is a holistic assessment since it aims to capture the interconnected and complex nature of water-related issues by considering multiple dimensional aspects which helps stakeholders and policymakers to understand the overall status of water security. This framework uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), involving pairwise comparison, normalisation and weighting. Then, a CWSI will be calculated using the Linear Aggregation method. The robustness of this consolidated index is validated using sensitivity analysis by modifying the weight in the linear aggregation formula. By following each step cautiously, a CWSI can be constructed and interpreted correctly, thus, becoming a powerful tool for conveying complex information to the different stakeholders and assessing the status of water security with river basins. The CWSI allows decision-makers to prioritise areas that are most at risk and facilitate sustainable planning and management of water resources.",2024

The aim of this review is to assess the knowledge transfer potential of online data pools for implementing and upscaling NBS. For that, we compared 21 online data pools that report on NBS case studies in terms of topics, availability and quality of information on NBS. We found a high variability in quantity, type and quality of the information documented, hindering comparability and limiting knowledge transfer. Our results show that the most common knowledge provided was on actions undertaken on NBS, their outcomes, case study site descriptions, specific challenges and information on responsible entities and partners. Information on key attributes of NBS, such as on ecosystem processes and services as well as on governance and financing issues, was often omitted.

Many studies have analyzed the expanding literature on environmental, social and governance (ESG) from various perspectives, but only a handful of this work directly informs the decision-making of practitioners like institutional investors. We address the mismatch by conducting a review of the literature that can benefit both academia and industry. Before commencing the review, we consulted experts in the industry by contacting institutional investors from Australia and Japan with Asset Under Management of as much as US$500 billion, along with others in the finance industry. These practitioners voiced limited interest in understanding the motivations of ESG-conscious investors, an area that many academic studies have examined. The most common of the practitioners' requests relates to how portfolios that are financially viable can be constructed to incorporate investors' ESG-related preferences. We conduct a systematic literature that is based on this feedback and find that, even in an ESG-themed investment vehicle, the investor's individual ESG preferences may not align well with the fund's objective and degree of conviction. We discuss the resulting challenges and opportunities investors face when integrating ESG into their investment practices, thus providing a guide for investors who wish to re-think their ESG strategies and beliefs.

This identified that data quality reporting was fragmented and limited, with a gap from best practice and a lack of standardisation around requirements specific to building performance, including data comparability and spatiotemporal granularity. Where data quality issues were diagnosed, this was in isolation and concerned individual data quality attributes rather than within a comprehensive data governance strategy.

Therefore, intensive efforts are being devoted to transforming food production and consumption patterns and developing alternative technological solutions to alleviate such issues.
Scope and approach
This review intends to discuss the interplay between food packaging, food waste, and sustainability. Some common strategies used in food packaging are briefly summarised. The significance of nanobiotechnology, smart sensors, and other fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) innovations is emphasized, focusing of the role of these smart technologies in the emergence of novel prospects, such as the development of active and intelligent packaging systems. In addition, insights on consumer acceptance of novel packaging materials/technologies are given and conclusions are drawn. Key findings and conclusions: Several innovative food packaging solutions based on Industry 4.0 technologies are being developed, changing the way food is packed and consumed. Indeed, growing evidence shows that digital technologies (particularly artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, and 3D printing) will have a greater impact on food packaging in the sense of “Packaging 4.0”. However, more research is still needed to fully harness the benefit of advanced technologies, enabling them to overcome current barriers and achieve a healthier and more sustainable food future.",2023

Although, scientific research in this direction has been neglected, and at the same time there are challenges to the attainment while meeting the need of the people. This study aims to investigate the impact of Industry 4.0, open innovation and green innovation performance on green innovation behaviour. To this end, a theoretical model was established. A quantitative research approach was applied in which survey data were utilized to capture 247 responses from different manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The model was tested using SmartPLSver3.0 to measure the structural relationship between variables. The findings indicate that Industry 4.0 and green innovation performance positively impact green innovation behaviour, compared to open innovation which has no impact. The impact of green innovation performance is found to be stronger when compared to Industry 4.0 and open innovation. Likewise, green innovation performance exhibits a substantial mediating impact between the exogenous variables and green innovation behaviour. The policy implication and conclusions are further discussed in the last section of the study.",2023

To address the malnutrition and poverty affecting approximately 700 million people in Africa, there is potential for the One Health approach implementation and operationalization to bring together multidisciplinary solutions for tackling food insecurity and ensuring food safety net. However, there is limited documentation on the potential of the One Health approach system thinking implementation to guide responses to triple crises-induced food insecurity. Therefore, this article aims to systematically understand the triple crises-induced food insecurity, connect existing solutions, and explore the role of the One Health approach in strengthening food and agriculture systems in Africa. Our finding showed the impact of triple crises exacerbating food system vulnerability in Africa and worldwide. Mitigating and resilient actions are urgently needed in tackling the emerging and persisting challenges, and infectious diseases menace and burden across Africa. We present a conceptual model illustrating the complex nature of triple crises-induced food insecurity, vulnerability areas within the food system, and actionable strategies for building community food resilience. Additionally, recommendations are provided to create an enabling environment that supports One Health approach implementation and addresses food insecurity challenges through innovative partnerships, local-led initiatives, and enhanced governance and artificial intelligence technology capacities in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth to reduce socio-economic inequalities. Stepping up integrated, actionable, and sustainable food systems programs and innovative long-lasting solutions requires investing in promoting new partnership and research collaboration in building conflict resolution and peace towards strengthening and reshaping local and global food security related climate change adaptations actions for most vulnerable communities’ benefits. These are ingredients in fastening preparedness, prevention and control of infectious diseases prevention and control, reducing food supply chains disruption towards accelerating equitable benefits of Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals, 2030 across Africa.",2023

The impact of human activities on the ECZ is currently underexplored, posing challenges for sustainable future development. Here we delve into the effects of industrialization, urbanization, and technological progress on resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and the loss of biodiversity, which lead to profound shifts in the ECZ's dynamics. Despite the substantial human influence on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, opportunities for positive change through technological innovation, environmental policy formulation, and enhanced global governance are identified. Drawing on examples from developed and developing nations, we discuss the disparities in environmental management and the potential for achieving a harmonious balance between economic growth, social equity, and environmental preservation within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper advocates for integrated approaches to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation, calling for strengthened international cooperation and the adoption of green development strategies.

As energy user participation is paramount for their success but has proven to be difficult to obtain, we explore the usefulness of the ‘social license’ concept, originally developed in the mining sector, to refer to the process of creating acceptance in DSM programs aimed at managing or controlling household energy resources such EVs, batteries, and heating and cooling devices. We argue that analyzing the attainment or lack of ‘social license’ may be useful to energy policy-makers and researchers for understanding public concerns with not only supply-side energy resources, but also DSM. We do so by (1) drawing attention to potential frictions between demands for flexibility on the one hand and social practices and habits on the other; (2) attending to the ways that users’ engagement in DSM programs is influenced by their sense of control and agency, and their trust in program providers; and (3) exploring the ways that users may understand their stake in the energy system and may participate in programs as collectives rather than simply as individuals. We argue that a ‘social license to automate’ could not only describe a set of tools to manage participation in DSM projects, but rather assess the ways users effectively feel part of new energy systems designed to serve them.",2021

The concepts are tightly connected to the debate on energy transition, and the need for a decentralised energy system, based on renewable energy and increased local energy ownership. The two concepts exist in parallel and are sometimes used as synonyms and sometimes with clear distinctions made between them. This spurred an interest to systematically investigate them further. The aim of this paper is to identify similarities and differences between the two concepts and synthesise their contributions to debates on citizen participation in energy transitions. We review the literature thematically, finding that the concepts often refer to participation in domestic energy technologies, energy communities, energy transition movements, and energy policy. Energy citizenship tends to emphasise behaviour change and ways for individuals to participate in energy systems, thereby often focusing on individuals as agents of change. In contrast, energy democracy tends to focus on institutionalisation of new forms of participative governance and often placing collectives as central agents of change. The review also highlights some weaknesses of the literature: a bias towards decentralised energy systems, a lack of attention to representational democracy, and an underrepresentation of studies from outside Europe and North America.",2022

Incorporating a novel measure of asset managers’ market timing ability, we analyze the role played by performance persistence in mutual fund investing decisions by focusing on top performers in a short-time window. Our empirical results showed that preferences strongly influence the returns-flow dynamics when accounting for the asset type, geographical investment focus, and management style tilt, shedding new light on the behavior of certain clustered groups of investors. Furthermore, we find a long-run information effect as a proxy of a positive association between past returns and flows leading by the smart money effect. Surprisingly, we also observe irrational investors’ behavior when chasing for negative performers, likely due to a herding effect or flow persistent hypothesis as a result of the mechanisms of market allocation efficiency, which is likely to be affected by a slowdown functioning in the short-term phase.

Within this paper we aimed to compare the conceptual designs of EC energy market topologies with some of their practical applications in Europe. Although previous studies have already examined selected SG topologies, our work provides an umbrella view of all potential designs of energy market configuration in which a community plays an active role. In addition, we follow a pragmatic approach, comparing theory with practice, and showing how the theoretical EC concept is currently embedded in reality. This paper answers two research questions: (1) Which of the theoretical EC network topologies are currently used in practice (2) How and which network topologies of EC have the greatest chance for the implementation in the future projects? To answer these questions, we conduct a literature review together with a comparison analysis of three case studies from the Netherlands and Denmark. This comparison allowed us to formulate some observations and further recommendations on formal structure, communication, and management, which, in our opinion, are significant for organizations planning to set up their first smart EC initiative, especially in countries where the EC concept has not gained popularity yet.",2022

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.",2022

Although existing literature primarily centres on the acceptance of these changes and their technologies, the growing number of low-carbon initiatives and renewable energy projects has prompted a substantial increase in literature exploring the social, political, and cultural resistance and opposition to these shifts. This study systematically analyses current literature to scrutinise the encountered resistance in transitioning toward a low-carbon economy. It extensively investigates the factors driving resistance across micro, meso, and macro levels, specifically focusing on three technology categories: consumer technologies, renewable energy, and smart energy systems. By synthesising insights from diverse studies that explore the political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of resistance, the primary aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge on energy transition and to provide insights that support more socially sustainable and democratic pathways toward low-carbon societies. Moreover, this study presents policy recommendations to address existing and potential resistance and opposition in this transition.

Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes’ measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency.

However, despite significant policy attention, NBS plans often fail to materialize due to public budget shortfalls. Alongside traditional public finance, the international debate increasingly urges the mobilization of private capital for NBS through alternative financing (AF) techniques. In this scoping review, we examine the literature on a) the AF models connected to NBS and b) the drivers and barriers associated with these AF models in terms of their financial technicity and their embeddedness in the political, economic, social, technological, legal/institutional, and environmental/spatial (“PESTLE”) context. Although many models are discussed, the results indicate that none can be considered full substitutes for traditional public finance. Barriers and drivers converge around seven overarching tensions: new revenue and risk distribution vs. uncertainty, budgetary and legal pressure vs. political willingness and risk aversion, market demand vs. market failures, private sector engagement vs. social acceptance and risks, legal and institutional conduciveness vs. inertia, and upscaling potential vs. environmental risks and land use. Future research should focus on a) how to further integrate NBS monitoring, quantification, valuation, and monetization into AF models, b) systemic and empirical approaches to improve the understanding of the applicability and transferability of AF models, and c) an exploration of the potential qualities and social risks of AF models in NBS governance arrangements.",2023

The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration offers immense potential to return hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded tropical landscapes to functioning ecosystems. Well-designed restoration can tackle multiple Sustainable Development Goals, driving synergistic benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem services, agricultural and timber production, and local livelihoods at large spatial scales. To deliver on this potential, restoration efforts must recognise and reduce trade-offs among objectives, and minimize competition with food production and conservation of native ecosystems. Restoration initiatives also need to confront core environmental challenges of climate change and inappropriate planting in savanna biomes, be robustly funded over the long term, and address issues of poor governance, inadequate land tenure, and socio-cultural disparities in benefits and costs. Tackling these issues using the landscape approach is vital to realising the potential for restoration to break the cycle of land degradation and poverty, and deliver on its core environmental and social promises.",2021

In the case of India, which has a densely populated coastline of 7516.6 km, developing effective policies and management strategies to cope with the current and future climate risks is imperative. The paper attempts to identify the major climate risks faced by coastal India through a systematic literature review between 1991 and 2022. Cyclones, Sea Level Rise, Floods, and Rainfall extremes accounted for more than 60 percent of the climate risks/issues on the Indian coast, with more pronounced incidences in the eastern coastal states than the western coastal states. We further analysed how different acts and policies associated with coastal management have addressed climate risks through a qualitative assessment of climate action plans of the Indian coastal states following the concept matrix approach. The results revealed that though a national-level policy is absent specifically for addressing coastal climate risks and adaptation, the coastal states have specific components on coastal vulnerabilities and adaptation. Further review of different states' disaster management acts, and policies emphasized the need for micro-level planning for climate-inclusive disaster management and building capacities of the concerned officials. The review of the evolution of coastal zone management in India revealed that there has been a dilution in the conservation of coastal ecosystems and reduction of no development zone under the pretext of enhancing livelihoods. The overall analysis of the national and state action plans, disaster management policies, and coastal regulation zone notifications in India shows that there is a need to include emerging climate risks in integrated planning and promote synergy amongst different sectors and institutions related to coastal governance and blue economy.",2024

Therefore, data sharing remains a challenge for specific data types and holders, making a bottleneck for further unleashing the potential of these “closed data.” To address this challenge, in this perspective, we conceptualize the current practices and technologies in data collaboration in a data-sharing-free manner and propose a concept of the model-sharing strategy for using closed data without sharing them. Supported by emerging advances in artificial intelligence, this strategy will unleash the large potential in closed data. Moreover, we show the advantages of the model-sharing strategy and explain how it will lead to a new paradigm of big data governance and collaboration.",2022

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.",2022

The need to achieve Sustainable Development (SD) is growing as well, and cosmetic companies are looking for innovative and sustainable solutions aimed at reducing their negative environmental, economic and social impacts. The interest in this field also regards the scientific community which investigates and proposes Circular Economy (CE) as a paradigm which could support companies in the transition towards a sustainable future. In this context, this study aims to analyze, through a bibliometric and systematic literature review, the state of the art of CE in the cosmetic industry by exploring the academic studies from different perspectives, such as the object of CE proposed solutions, the research methods applied, and the 4Rs principles inspiring the CE practices. In addition, the link between circular practices and sustainability is also investigated. The analysis permits to classify the circular practices into four categories: input valorization, packaging solution, output valorization, and governance and management. The main results show that the highest attention of CE practices is focused on the input valorization for the formulation of cosmetic products. In this regard, a link between agri-food and chemical sectors and the cosmetic industry emerges due to the high number of studies focused on the valorization of agri-food waste and by-products. On the other hand, packaging and output valorization options are less investigated among the scientific community. Finally, the category of governance and management highlights the importance of circular strategies not only in the production phase, but also at the organizational level, for example by proposing specific circular business models. Finally, the results highlight the existence of a link between circularity and sustainability concept, specifically focusing on the environmental dimension.",2024

Additionally, this study samples studies from West Africa for concluding rather than studies that predominate the Global North. Guided by the literature from the Global North and West Africa, an integrative review of literature and a content analysis of 52 sampled studies based on a literature search strategy was undertaken. The study identifies that energy security in West Africa is characterised by one region-specific factor (i.e., investment), five cross-sectors factors (i.e., governance, sustainability, reliability, affordability and regional energy pools), three sector-specific factors for the electricity sub-sector (i.e., energy demand-side management) and oil and gas sub-sector (i.e., availability and security). The three sector-specific factors for the electricity and oil and gas are also non-regional factors. The study concludes that energy security in the Global North and West Africa is characterised by similar cross-sector factors i.e., Governance, sustainability, reliability, affordability, regional energy integration and similar sector-specific factors i.e., energy demand-side management, availability and security. The difference lies largely in the region-specific factors and thinly in the nature of the manifestations of similar factors in both regions which may be influenced by sub-regional needs, risks and ambitions. The study increases the Africa voice on the subject. It also identifies that factors such as sustainability, security, energy sector investment has been understudied and as such future studies should focus on these factors.",2021

In both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower patients with regard to their data, respectively.",2022

Telemonitoring (TM) has been identified as a valuable solution, particularly for chronically ill, long-term or socially isolated patients. Several initiatives have since emerged. Thus, Portuguese stakeholders recognise the need to reflect upon TM's current state and prospects. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the TM landscape in Portugal. We begin by analysing the underlying conditions for telehealth development. Then, we describe the governmental strategy and priorities towards TM – the National Strategic Plan for Telehealth development and NHS reimbursement opportunities for TM. To understand TM implementation, adoption, and dissemination in Portugal, we analyse 46 reported initiatives and adoption studies focusing on providers’ perspectives. Finally, a structured reflection on current challenges and the way forward is provided, according to the seven domains of the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. The adoption of TM by Portuguese institutions has been growing, leveraged by the telehealth governance model and public reimbursement mechanisms, proving particularly relevant during the pandemic. However, monitored patients are still few. Low digital literacy among patients and providers, lack of care integration and resource scarcity represent barriers hampering pilot TM initiatives’ scale-up.",2023

A critical review of energy transition scholarship,"Youth, Energy transition, Energy citizens, Engagement, Renewable energy","Youth are increasingly recognized in global arenas as critical actors for achieving sustainable development goals, including just energy transitions. Many scholars similarly argue the importance of engaging youth in energy transitions; yet, there is limited understanding of whether and how youth are framed as legitimate actors in energy transitions scholarship. This paper examines how recent energy transitions research conceptualizes youth, specifically whether youth are approached as influential energy citizens or merely as passive actors. Results show that the majority of research does not frame youth as energy citizens per se; rather, the dominant focus is on energy literacy and the importance of educating youth about energy options. This is followed by scholarship exploring youth perspectives on, or testing youth knowledge about, different energy technologies, youth energy conservation behaviour, and youth climate advocacy. Limited scholarship has focused on the role and influence of youth in energy governance. Research is needed at the national to international scale, focused on the rationale, value added and influence of youth in the multi-lateral energy space, and at local or community scale, enabling youth's roles in local energy planning and renewable energy projects.",2024

Agricultural knowledge and advice networks are important components of agricultural innovation systems that have the potential to be digitally disrupted. In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise.

By describing the characteristics of a ‘healthy sustainable city’ and by bringing together the ideas underlying frameworks for health and sustainability, we develop a conceptual understanding of how cities may progress towards achieving significant improvements in health and the environment. We investigate how urban change works, and build a theoretical understanding of how urban change may be directed to integrate health and sustainability. We conclude that urban transformation needs to be a multi-scalar process across city sectors to meet the scale, speed and form of change required.

Power generation from clean energy sources may help to meet societal needs such as increasing electricity demand while complying with contemporary global challenges (e.g. climate change). This paper aims at qualitatively describing the development of clean energy technologies in Mexico by using a multi-perspective analytical framework. By integrating a meta-theoretical framework for national energy transitions and core concepts from policy mixes for sustainability transitions literature, a series of stylised facts are developed to qualitatively describe the evolution of clean energy technologies in Mexico from 1879 to 2021. Interactive governance theory is used as an analytical framework to synthesise these storylines by highlighting the role and interactions among technologies, actors, and policy instruments in governance processes. The case study revealed that the ever-growing electricity demand in Mexico have called for exploring different available energy sources and technologies over time. Diminishing oil and gas domestic reserves, increasing concerns around environmental issues, and worldwide agreements on greenhouse gas emission reductions have been the main drivers for clean energy and energy efficiency development in Mexico. However, different barriers to a clean energy transition in Mexico have been identified and discussed in this study: (1) access to a vast oil and gas resources in the past reinforced the position of fossil-fuel incumbent regimes, displacing clean energy technological niches; (2) lack of investment in clean energy research, development, and innovation; (3) policy paradigms have shifted based on (dynamic) societal needs and socio-political interests in favour of fossil fuel power generation. To overcome these barriers and allow a transition towards a clean energy electricity system in Mexico, multiple policy instruments have been identified and discussed.",2022

In this article we present a comprehensive review on cities’ experience in climate mitigation policy and policy learning, focusing on research published in journal articles. We provide observations from the literature on municipal experience in policy practice and on how local governments manage learning in urban mitigation policy. The review provides valuable examples and reflections on individual policy initiatives, both in terms of policy framing and policy instruments, but finds sporadic evidence on systematically successful policy learning and capacity building processes in the scientific literature. The number of scientific articles on empirical assessments of local policy learning are few, and the research found, published in numerous journals, potentially addressing different research communities, provides limited knowledge on policy learning in terms of lessons learned, lessons drawing and capacity building.

China implemented the first phase of its National Healthy Cities pilot program from 2016-20. Along with related urban health governmental initiatives, the program has helped put health on the agenda of local governments while raising public awareness. Healthy City actions taken at the municipal scale also prepared cities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after intermittent trials spanning the past two decades, the Healthy Cities initiative in China has reached a crucial juncture. It risks becoming inconsequential given its overlap with other health promotion efforts, changing public health priorities in response to the pandemic, and the partial adoption of the Healthy Cities approach advanced by the World Health Organization (WHO). We recommend aligning the Healthy Cities initiative in China with strategic national and global level agendas such as Healthy China 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing an integrative governance framework to facilitate a coherent intersectoral program to systemically improve population health. Achieving this alignment will require leveraging the full spectrum of best practices in Healthy Cities actions and expanding assessment efforts.

CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective.

The objective is to synthesise, appraise and extend current understanding of the existing conceptual/theoretical/empirical literature on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial and non-financial performance measures. We adopt a three-step SLR approach to analyse/review one of the largest SLR datasets employed to-date, consisting of 140 multi-methods and theoretical CSR studies conducted globally across multiple disciplines over the 2004–2019 period, published in top-ranked journals. Our findings are as follows. First, a large number of the existing studies are descriptive and/or draw on single rather than multi-theoretical perspectives. Second, existing studies have focused mainly on how CSR is related to financial performance measures to the neglect of non-financial performance measures. Third, observable methodological limitations include the dearth of qualitative, mixed-methods and cross-cultural/developing/country studies.

In this review paper, we synthesize the OI literature using a context-mechanism-outcome approach to identify and classify the various mechanisms observed in empirical OI studies. Our findings demonstrate that the OI literature draws on a wide variety of mechanisms originating from the fields of management, sociology, economics, and psychology. The fifteen mechanisms most frequently observed in the literature fall into four categories: governance and policies; environmental dynamics and interactions; knowledge, skills, and capabilities; and learning by doing. Moreover, by examining the levels of analysis of these mechanisms, we observe substantial differences in how these mechanisms operate at the individual, project, firm, network, and society level. Finally, we identify various avenues for future research arising from our synthesis of the literature.",2023

Concepts such as Peer-to-peer energy trading (P2P), transactive energy (TE) and community/collective self-consumption (CSC) are frequently mentioned as solutions to this challenge. Despite increasing interest from industry, policy, and academia, the field lacks a shared understanding of this class of models. This need is addressed by presenting sets of shared and distinct characteristics which define P2P, TE and CSC. Our analysis is based on a series of expert group interviews with regulators, industry, and academics across 13 countries, and a systematic and targeted literature review of 133 papers. Findings show that P2P/TE/CSC models can be described as sub-markets that operate within or alongside traditional energy markets and enable trading or sharing of energy using an automated approach. They focus on promoting and supporting local energy generation and consumption using price negotiation mechanisms that reflect the aims of the market. The paper also presents sets of characteristics which differentiate P2P, TE, and CSC from one another and sets out guiding definitions to be used as a reference point. The main differences between these models stem from the goal they are trying to achieve and the contexts they are deployed in. Findings from this analysis can support development of a shared understanding of this class of models across multiple disciplinary perspectives and applications.",2024

We review and characterize the landscape of digital innovations in the Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region. We highlight major success stories associated with the potential of digital innovations to facilitate rural market transformation and support climate action, including adaptation and mitigation. Our desk and landscape review identifies various digital innovations used in Egypt, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. We then create a typology of digital innovations based on seven broad service categorizations: weather and climate; agricultural finance; energy and early warning systems; data and crowdsourcing; market information and market place; extension and advisory information; and supply chain coordination. Three technical and validation workshops supplement this review. Our review shows that digital innovations have the potential to build resilience to climate change and increase market access, but their adoption remains low and varying across contexts. Significant heterogeneity and differences exist across these countries, possibly due to different institutional and regulatory frameworks that guide demand and capacity. We identify several supply and demand-side constraints facing the digital ecosystem in the region. There is the existence of a significant digital divide fueled by gender, literacy gaps, and related socioeconomic and psychosocial constraints. A seeming disconnect also exists between pilots and scale-ups, as most existing digital applications are unsuccessful in expanding beyond the pilot phase.",2024

Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.",2022

There is a need to deepen insights on the characteristics of the emergent phenomenon of nature-based living labs, with respect to their predecessors. Accordingly, the paper first develops an outline of how living labs evolved into nature-based living labs, informed by bibliometric analysis. Second, the unique characteristics of nature-based living labs are identified using a systematic literature review. Finally, the core characteristics of living labs are determined, and nature-based living labs are placed within this context. Initial living labs had a strong technological focus, which proliferated into diverse application domains and regions after the European Network of Living Labs was established and expanded. Urban living labs emerged as a significant multidisciplinary and geographically specific domain, while nature-based living labs are inherently sustainability-oriented and consider ecosystem processes, interactions, and natural materials. Next, the paper identifies nine characteristics of nature-based living labs, five of which are always present, namely: (i) real-life spatial context and multi-scale, (ii) innovation and learning, (iii) user-centric, (iv) multi-actor involvement and (v) sustainability-oriented multiple benefits. Then, the four core characteristics of living labs, the variation within these characteristics, and how these align with the characteristics of nature-based living labs are clarified. Finally, the need for research on living labs across application domains and regions is highlighted, so that the global applicability of these local, user-centric, innovative approaches can be established.",2024

A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent to a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Research indicates that they can substantially enhance productivity and sustainability, and are able to deal with the increasing scarcity of green labour in greenhouse horticulture. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on Digital Twin applications in greenhouse horticulture. The review identifies 8 articles that explicitly address Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture and 115 studies that implicitly apply the Digital Twin concept in smart IoT-based systems. Findings indicate that the concept of the Digital Twin is in a seminal phase in greenhouse horticulture, but there are existing applications that are not yet framed as Digital Twins. In the reviewed papers, there is a dominant focus on the cultivation process at the greenhouse level, among others for climate control, energy management and lighting. About 9% of the articles are virtualizing plants themselves, which indicates that the granularity level addressed is still rather limited. Only 7 % of the articles look beyond plants or single greenhouses. None of the reviewed articles consider the company level. Furthermore, most applications address monitoring and control of the state and behaviour of real-life objects. More advanced applications, including predictive and prescriptive capabilities across the complete lifecycle, are still in an early stage of development, although predictive Digital Twins are gaining prominence.",2022

The review focuses on how these concerns and/or practices emerge across the socio-technical narratives that characterise RES prosumers' research. The study takes stock of a machine-learning topic model and a qualitative thematic coding to identify and discuss key topics, themes, and narrative elements related to sufficiency and inclusivity in RES prosumerism. The results show a crosscutting narrative from early discussions (2005–2018) on energy citizenship, grassroots initiatives, and collective prosumer initiatives, to regulated and institutionalised energy communities (2019–2023). The narrative highlights the relational and systemic dynamics of prosumer projects, embedded in local socioeconomic, sociopolitical, and cultural contexts, and shows that inclusivity and sufficiency have not always been major concerns. However, there are exceptions found in research into “energy commons” and “grassroots innovations”. These findings are discussed in relation to the role of new policy options for sustainable RES prosumerism.

To overcome these challenges, the European Parliament has recently approved the Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse to standardise the legal requirements of wastewater to be considered fit for reuse. This regulation also requires elaboration of Water Reuse Risk Management Plans (WRRMPs) for all reclamation facilities of the Union. This review aims to provide a general overview of the current limitations and gaps in systematically applying water-reuse practices, as well as recommendations that could overcome them. To this end, WRRMPs and digital solutions can play a crucial role because they can ensure the safe use of reclaimed water in agriculture and support communications to stakeholders, end-users and citizens.

Even though the integration of intelligent technologies offers unlimited potential in precision commercial agriculture, optimal resource management remains a challenge considering that IoT infrastructure is unevenly distributed across the world and concentrated in high-income countries. The utilization of IoT technologies in smart greenhouses often involves a tradeoff between the cost of agricultural production, environmental conservation, ecological degradation, and sustainability. The installation of IoT infrastructure is capital-intensive and often translates to higher energy demand, that elevates the risk for climate change. The widespread use of IoT sensors and networks also increases new challenges in the management of electronic waste, depletion of finite resources, and destruction of fragile ecosystems, resulting in climate change. the integration of IoT systems in greenhouses would be augmented by the global deployment of advanced 5G technology and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation broadband internet with low latency and high speeds. Intelligent application of agrochemicals could yield significant savings ($500/acre or more), while need-based irrigation and fertilizer application would help improve crop yields. Globally, the deployment of IoT infrastructure would yield about $500 billion of added value to the GDP by 2030. The forecasted economic benefits affirm that the applications of IoT for optimized greenhouse environment and resources management were sustainable, and any potential risks are incomparable to the long-term benefits in commercial agriculture.

In addition, the paper explores the similarities and differences of extractivism across the region. While there is a common pattern of deeper dependence on the extraction of natural resources all across Latin America, a transnational and comparative analysis of the processes of politicisation of extractivism that have occurred in different countries allows for an understanding of the subtleties and differences of each form of governance of natural resources. Through a comparative analysis of different countries in the region I argue that, despite political ideologies of different governments, it is possible to observe an increasing dependence on extractivism. Such continuity has created expectations in terms of poverty, inequality and unemployment reduction, which generates popular support for extractivism. Yet, it has also led to extensive human rights violations at the local level, creating limitations for social mobilisation.",2020

Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required.

This paper aims to examine the strategic role of world-class universities and the international academic profession in the regionalisation project of China’s Greater Bay Area (GBA). It illustrates the way in which the case of the GBA regionalisation project offers a potentially rich empirical example for adding contextual understanding to the literature of the Triple Helix model, which largely draws on inductive theorising from western successful innovation cases. The GBA regionalisation processes will provide a wealth of empirical cases for identifying circumstances that address tensions and increase interactions in the Triple Helix relationship of university, government and industry for fostering knowledge synergies.
Design/methodology/approach
Focusing on the case of Hong Kong, it engages in policy and stakeholder analysis and addresses three key research questions: What are the competitive advantages and potential strategic role of Hong Kong's universities and academic profession in the regionalisation of innovation systems in the GBA? What is the role of the governments in the regionalisation processes? What are the expected opportunities and challenges offered by the GBA policy initiatives for the future development of Hong Kong’s universities and academic profession?
Findings
Hong Kong, given its status as an international finance centre and global city with intense internationalisation and established judicial system operated by the rule of law, will contribute to the GBA development by leveraging on its edge in scientific research and development and international networks of academic research through the world-class academic profession. Scientists and researchers in the city, possessing the competitive advantages of basic research and international partnerships, are highly regarded by the central government. The engagement of Hong Kong’s scientific talents, can play an important role in achieving China’s aspiration of becoming a global technology power.
Research limitations/implications
Analysis of this article implies that the GBA concept is currently China’s ambitious but vague economic plan. The opportunities in which key node cities and knowledge/ innovation clusters will capture and capitalise from the regional ‘co-opetitive” ’entrepreneurial ecosystem are still unclear. The future of the GBA regionalisation is so dynamic and open-ended that grounded concepts related to the governance innovation/ discourse of ‘one country two systems’ and social connectedness and capitalisation with Chinese characteristics will help in making sense of the contextualisation of a Chinese regional innovation system and enhancing the sophistication of reconceptualisation of the Triple Helix model.
Originality/value
This article will add to the literature some novel contextualised knowledge about the GBA’s potential triple-helix relationship between government-university-industry in the 21st century. The empirical example of China’s GBA will also shed light on a new understanding of the role of international social capital in the entrepreneurial knowledge economy, dynamics between basic and applied research, and a synergistic interface between regionalisation and national innovation system.",2020

Blockchain is rapidly evolving to be a new infrastructure for building robust distributed applications. Similarly, Internet of things is getting increasing deployment in the context of smart city, smart home, smart healthcare, etc. On the intersection of the two emerging areas, researchers are proposing to use blockchain to build more dependable IoT systems. This paper reviews the most recent research advances in this direction during the past four years. Specifically, we review, summarize, and categorize existing research works. We divide the research works into four groups according to the roles that the blockchain plays in IoT systems, i.e., access control platform, data security platform, trusted third party, and automatic payment platform. For each group, we also discuss future research challenges. From the review, we further summarize the usage paradigms and open issues on using blockchain to build dependable IoT systems. We hope this work serves as a reference of existing models for both researchers and engineers that are interested to leverage blockchain to build future IoT systems.",2020

In this paper, we attempt to make sense of the notion of a ‘collective’ central to the STI approach. We do so by performing a literature review of 69 peer-reviewed empirical articles that specifically delve into STIs concerning energy systems and transitions. We ask how ‘collective’ or ‘collectively held imaginary’ is defined and mobilised in these studies and what methods and empirical material scholars employ to access it analytically. Our literature review reveals a predominant emphasis on national collectives, frequently serving as the primary lens for analysis, with studies also exploring the interplay between national and local/regional STIs. Beyond the nation-state, we find instances of research delving into local/regional collectives and internationally or transnationally held STIs. Moreover, we illustrate how the choice of a specific ‘collective’ entry point influences methodological choices. Drawing from our literature review, we call for a more critical and comprehensive engagement with the notion of a ‘collective’ to elucidate how and why specific STIs gain prominence and power or lose acceptance and are marginalised within various collectives, especially in the context of low-carbon energy transitions. We further urge STI scholars to focus on diverse collectives that contribute to a sense of belonging beyond the confines of scale and place, such as class, gender, race, or ethnicity. Additionally, we emphasise the role of individuals, including those less socially prominent, in (re)shaping energy imaginaries.",2024

Blockchain presents time-stamped and immutable blocks of data that are not owned by any single entity but rather managed by a group of nodes or computers where each block is secured and linked using cryptographic principles. The immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain has redefined trust, ownership, identity, and financial systems by providing a secure, fast, transparent, and pseudo-anonymous solution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of blockchain technology focusing on the historical background, underlying principles, and the sudden rise in the popularity of blockchain technology. The paper also discusses the various consensus algorithms of blockchain technology. Next, the paper focuses on the various application areas and prospective use cases of blockchain technology with the underlying challenges and issues. Further, the paper presents some unconventional use cases of blockchain technology. The study also reviews state-of-the-art articles to provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects of blockchain technology in varied domains. The comparison between traditional database systems and blockchain technology is presented, and the appropriate scenarios where blockchain-based solutions may or may not provide the best solutions are also discussed.

The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.",2024

It boosts the power system with the advantage of using intelligent infrastructure to aid monitoring, protection, bidirectional communication, supply safety, security and self-healing characteristics. ICT infrastructures are integrated into the power network by using technologies, such as active distribution networks, smart cities and societies, dynamic line ratings, special protection schemes and demand-side management programmes. Deployment of these technologies has beneficial impacts on the reliability of power systems. However, these infrastructures are naturally prone to failures and cybersecurity issues because of Internet of things standards, which can further jeopardise system reliability. Various studies have examined the effect of these technologies on the reliability of power systems whilst ignoring that the associated ICTs could be unavailable. Thus, this work comprehensively reviews studies that go beyond component-based reliability assessment and accounts for the impact of ICT integrations on system-wide reliability whilst explicitly considering the effects of malfunctions of the cyber system. Moreover, the paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about the impact of ICT deployed with various smart grid technologies and applications on the reliability of modern power systems.",2020

The aims and objectives of this study are threefold: to interrogate which sociotechnical concepts or tools from STS are useful at better understanding energy-related social science, to reflect on prominent themes and topics within those approaches, and to identify current research gaps and directions for the future. To do so, the study builds on a companion project, a systematic analysis of 262 articles published from 2009 to mid-2019 that categorized and reviewed sociotechnical perspectives in energy social science. It identifies future research directions by employing the method of “co-creation” based on the reflections of sixteen prominent researchers in the field in late 2019 and early 2020. Drawing from this co-created synthesis, this study first identifies three main areas of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research (sociotechnical systems, policy, and expertise and publics) with 15 topics and 39 subareas. The study then identifies five main themes for the future development of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research: conditions of systematic change; embedded agency; justice, power, identity and politics; imaginaries and discourses; and public engagement and governance. It also points to the recognized need for pluralism and parallax: for research to show greater attention to demographic and geographical diversity; to stronger research designs; to greater theoretical triangulation; and to more transdisciplinary approaches.",2020

Regional authorities have undertaken a number of actions in order to stimulate public-private collaboration and implementation of projects that can benefit from the EU funding aiming to accelerate the transformation of Andalusian economy and to make it more circular and less carbon intensive. While the private enterprises in the region focus mainly on recovery of agricultural and food waste, the citizen initiatives target primarily the reduction of residential waste, promoting the reutilization of furniture, home appliances and closing. Unfortunately, the initiatives of Andalusian authorities often lack harmonization with both the EU and Spanish strategies in the field. The main documents that govern the development of circular economy in the region frequently set imprecise qualitative goals, rather than binding quantitative targets to be achieved within a certain period of time. As a corollary, there is a poor coordination among the public administration, business sector and the society and insufficient provision of public funding for circular projects. We, therefore, recommend Andalusian government to build up the framework of regulatory, fiscal and economic tools that can incentivize the circular economy and to increase transparency, monitoring, reporting, and recognition of progress. It is essential to introduce both the rewarding and penalization schemes that enable behavioral changes of producers and consumers, to set the concrete numerical goals and to harmonize the main programs with the Spanish and the EU strategies in the field of circular economy.",2023

As countries continue to develop climate policies, in particular adaptation strategies, it is evident that these need to be articulated more effectively across multiple policy domains and jurisdictions. Climate policy integration is often sought to improve policy coherence and climate governance at different scales. The aim of this paper is to better understand to what degree climate policy integration is being achieved and what are the common barriers and enablers. Additional emphasis is placed on identifying challenges and opportunities specifically relevant to food systems and the attainment of food security goals. The study was conducted using the PRISMA Statement and four-phase diagram for reporting results of systematic reviews. The dataset analysed included 209 peer-review articles published in the period 2010−2020. The review shows that although climate policy integration is increasingly discussed as a preferred strategy to deal more effectively with complex and multiple policy domains, existing institutional and governance structures pose barriers to the effective integration of climate goals across sectors, approaches and jurisdictions. There are specific opportunities and challenges for food systems and food security. Among these opportunities are the conceptual compatibility which can be derived from land-use strategies that generate synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development goals. In addition, the agricultural sector has often developed vertical structures for the delivery of support services which can be utilized to facilitate vertical integration and implementation of strategies. In contrast, the legislative legacy and often complicated processes of policy layering, drift and conversion in land-use sectors challenge the achievement of policy coherence.",2021

It is therefore necessary to assess, simulate, and manage the vulnerability of desertified regions from the perspective of the social-ecological system, to support desertification control and sustainable development. This study is a systematic review of the vulnerability of the social-ecological system in desertified regions (SESDR) based on a bibliometric analysis, and a summary of the research progresses in vulnerability assessment, simulation, and sustainable management is provided. It was found that SESDR vulnerability research started relatively late, but has developed rapidly in recent years, with an emphasis on the coupling between natural systems and human activities, and multi-scale interactions and dynamics. Using various indicators at different scales, SESDR vulnerability could be assessed in terms of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability. Modeling the complex interactions among natural and human factors across multiple scales is essential to simulate the vulnerability dynamics of the SESDR. The sustainable management of SESDR vulnerability focuses on rational spatial planning to achieve the maximum benefits, with the right measures in the right places. Four priority research directions were proposed to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of vulnerability and smart restoration of desertified land. The findings of this study will enable researchers, land managers, and policymakers to develop a more comprehensive understanding of SESDR vulnerability, thereby enabling them to better address the challenges posed by complex resource and environmental issues.",2024

It transcends traditional assessments conducted in “silos”, raising trade-offs and synergies that are rarely acknowledged. The nexus framework is intrinsically context-specific, as each respective region has particularities in terms of critical interlinkages. Brazil is the world's eighth largest economy [1] and is heavily reliant on natural resources. This paper considers Brazil to be a textbook case for nexus research that identifies critical interlinkages that are neglected by literature, which is typically based on single-resource analysis. It proposes a research agenda to advance resource nexus assessments and improve resource governance in Brazil. We propose a novel method for nexus research, systematically reviewing geographical context-specific papers in relevant single nexus dimensions and establishing resource interlinkages that characterise research gaps and policy priorities. We found that 36% of practices reviewed involve more than one resource at a time, characterising interlinkages not analysed by the literature. Lastly, selected quantitative indicators were used to identify critical interlinkages by analysing the representativeness of practices in the national context, and the relevance of synergies or trade-offs for Brazil. Critical interlinkages in Brazil were found to be irrigation for energy crop expansion (water, food and energy); transport biofuels and fuelwood (water, energy, food); deforestation for new pasture (water, energy, food); and hydropower generation (water and energy). These are, therefore, priorities for future nexus research and for efforts to address synergies and trade-offs in resource governance.",2021

An important element shaping farmers’ adaptation decisions and their vulnerability is their respective land tenure system. Especially land tenure security can strongly influence farmers’ incentives for adapting to climate change. We review the literature to understand to what extent tenure security and other land tenure characteristics affect farmers’ ability to withstand climate change and how climate change is operationalised. 106 mostly peer-reviewed studies are examined using thematic network analysis and a network of interactions between land tenure and climate change in farming contexts is devised. The results show that three main interactions link land tenure systems and climate change with regard to agricultural livelihoods: (i) land tenure characteristics influence farmers’ adaptation uptake, type and intensity, (ii) certain tenure settings contribute to vulnerability of different socio-demographic groups in agricultural systems, e.g. women, migrants and indigenous communities, and (iii) the perception of tenure security itself is affected by climate change. Yet, the concept of tenure security is poorly defined in most studies, at times resulting in misleading conclusions and leaving important research gaps with regard to optimal land tenure incentives for farmers’ adaptation response. Climate change is often simplistically integrated into the assessments, without validation and analysis of longer term trends. None of the studies reviewed provides a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the multiple dimensions linking climate change and land tenure. Further exploration and empirical validation of the connection between land tenure and climate change in agricultural systems is thus warranted. This should include a more critical engagement with the exigencies of climate change response for agricultural systems, such as the need for flexible approaches to deal with climatic uncertainty. The results of this review are relevant for informing adaptation policy, where sustainable land governance has an integral role to play. Designing smart land tenure interventions based on improved understanding of (local) interactions between land tenure and climate can support farmers in effectively addressing the adverse effects of climate change.",2022

This review aimed to examine how mobile health (mHealth) to support integrated people-centred health services has been implemented and evaluated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR).
Methods
Eight scientific databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in title and abstract stages, followed by full-text appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis of eligible studies. Studies were extracted to capture details of the mhealth tools used, the service issues addressed, the study design, and the outcomes evaluated. We then mapped the included studies using the 20 sub-strategies of the WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS); as well as with the RE-AIM (Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework, to understand how studies implemented and evaluated interventions.
Results
We identified 39 studies, predominantly from Australia (n = 16), China (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 4) and New Zealand (n = 4), and little from low income countries. The mHealth modalities included text messaging, voice and video communication, mobile applications and devices (point-of-care, GPS, and Bluetooth). Health issues addressed included: medication adherence, smoking cessation, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, and lifestyle activities respectively. Almost all were community-based and focused on service issues; only half were disease-specific. mHealth facilitated integrated IPCHS by: enabling citizens and communities to bypass gatekeepers and directly access services; increasing affordability and accessibility of services; strengthening governance over the access, use, safety and quality of clinical care; enabling scheduling and navigation of services; transitioning patients and caregivers between care sectors; and enabling the evaluation of safety and quality outcomes for systemic improvement. Evaluations of mHealth interventions did not always report the underlying theories. They predominantly reported cognitive/behavioural changes rather than patient outcomes. The utility of mHealth to support and improve IPCHS was evident. However, IPCHS strategy 2 (participatory governance and accountability) was addressed least frequently. Implementation was evaluated in regard to reach (n = 30), effectiveness (n = 24); adoption (n = 5), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 1).
Conclusions
mHealth can transition disease-centred services towards people-centred services. Critical appraisal of studies highlighted methodological issues, raising doubts about validity. The limited evidence for large-scale implementation and international variation in reporting of mHealth practice, modalities used, and health domains addressed requires capacity building. Information-enhanced implementation and evaluation of IPCHS, particularly for participatory governance and accountability, is also important.",2020

The competency-based undergraduate curriculum reform at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Faculty of Medicine (UMP-FM) is detailed and reviewed in reference to the instructional and institutional reforms, and enabling actions recommended by the Lancet 2010 Commission for Health Professional Education. Key objectives are to: revise the overall 6-year curriculum to be more integrated and competency-based; reinforce students’ knowledge application, problem-solving, clinical competence, self-directed learning and soft skills; develop a comprehensive and performance-based student assessment programme; and establish a comprehensive quality monitoring programme to facilitate changes and improvements. New features include early introduction to the practice of medicine, family- and community-based medicine, professionalism, interprofessional education, electives experiences, and a scholarly project. Institutional reform introduces a faculty development programme, joint planning mechanism, a “culture of critical inquiry”, and a transparent faculty reward system. Lessons learnt from the curriculum reform at UMP-FM could be helpful to medical schools from low- and middle-income countries considering transitioning from a traditional to a competency-based curriculum.

However, construction CE is limited due to its unique industrial characteristics and the complex nature of CE. To tackle wicked CE challenges, Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) are recognised as promising solutions since they provide potential support to CE-oriented decision-making. However, the effectiveness and challenges of applying ICT to a broader decision-making context to implement CE in the built environment remain unexplored. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive overview of ICT-based decision support tools applied to implement construction CE. Through a systematic literature review, 62 papers published during 2010–2021 are selected, categorised, and analysed. First, the state-of-the-art of these tools is described. Then, a theoretical framework is proposed to articulate the mechanism of how ICT-based tools support circular construction/demolition practices throughout the building life-cycle. The research and development of ICT-based decision support tools are vital to successful construction CE implementation. However, scant attention has been devoted to integrating relevant technologies in a comprehensive information system by considering the complex landscape of CE. Based on critical literature analysis, challenges of applying ICT to support CE are identified from technology, business, and societal perspectives. Furthermore, recommendations for future research directions are provided including the conceptual reference architecture of a Circularity Information Platform that demonstrates the desirable technology integration.

However, traditional ML solutions operate on centralized data collection and processing. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution to train ML models on multiple decentralized devices without effectively sharing private data. Therefore, FL offers a secure architecture to handle highly sensitive data in the IoHT context. This survey comprehensively reviews emerging data security and privacy applications for FL in IoHT networks. First, we present a background overview of the basic concepts of FL applied in IoHT. In particular, we rigorously investigate and evaluate the main solutions to IoHT data security and privacy issues. In addition, we categorize the most relevant publications related to IoHT data security, whether due to advances in the architecture of FL or data protection. Next, we list several IoHT network datasets for model training. Finally, we highlight the essential lessons from this review, highlighting current challenges and possible directions for future research in data security and privacy in IoHT networks using FL.",2023

The recent shockwaves from the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have made nations rethink their energy transition strategies. For various governments to encourage carbon neutrality, there is a dire necessity for widespread research on the expansion of greener energy sources. This bibliometric review sheds light on the significant contributions in the field of energy transition research in the past four decades and suggests future research roadmaps. By compiling a map of scholarly publications on energy transition, this study uses the PRISMA technique and bibliometric software like VOS-viewer, cite-space, and R-Biblioshiny to map the research findings of scholarly publications listed in Scopus and Web of Science during 1981–2021. Our analysis shows that aspects like climate change, alternative energy, governance approach, and emission reduction are increasingly important. Further, areas that require future research include developing policy frameworks, energy infrastructure (storage and transfer), renewable energy ecosystem, clean energy economic analysis, and impact assessment for timely energy transition across the globe. Therefore, collaboration among nations and research institutions should be advanced with a particular focus on clean technology development and knowledge transfer for rapid energy transition across continents.",2022

This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.",2020

However, energy resilience is at its pregnancy stage with inconsistency in multiple perspectives, ranging from concept definition to quantification approach. Moreover, the consideration of energy resilience will conflict with energy efficiency, calling for the necessity on trade-off solutions. In this study, in order to ensure the survivability of district power systems when suffering from extreme events, an up-to-date review on concept definition and quantification approach of energy resilience was conducted, together with distinguished boundary and correlation with reliability, robustness, and flexibility in multi-energy systems. Recent advancement in distributed renewable systems, electric vehicles, peer-to-peer energy sharing, electrification and hydrogenation in power systems was provided, together with their potential contributions in future smart energy systems. By enabling each agent to become a power supply agent, a typology transformation from centralized to distributed energy prosumers was proposed, with an intermediate step-by-step transition from centralized power plants to distributed energy prosumers. Afterwards, multi-scale applications and future prospects of energy resilience are provided, including resilient heating/cooling of buildings, dynamical downscaling for robust design on urban morphology, mobility-based interactive energy sharing in regional districts, and smart microgrids with V2X (vehicle-to-everything) and energy flexible buildings. This study can highlight the significance in district energy resilience with joint and continuous endeavors and tradeoff solutions, during energy planning, design and operation stages.",2023

In this context, resilience-building represents a relevant challenge for urban managers, mainly due to the barriers to integrating diverse infrastructure subsystems at different governance levels. Thus, this study aims to analyze risk management tools' contribution to urban infrastructure services' resilient planning. The research developed risk management tools that were incorporated into the decision-making process of resilient urban planning. The tools were applied to a case study in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, relating characteristics of its infrastructure to operationalization principles of urban resilience in the literature. The results revealed that the risk management tools could promote a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and threats of the infrastructure network under climate risks, based on the technical experience and engagement of multiple stakeholders in decision making.

A critical review of regional equity in decarbonisation pathways,"Spatial justice, Regional development, Low carbon transition, Responsibility, Capability, Decarbonisation","Spatial justice is a theoretical framework that is increasingly used to examine questions of equity in the low carbon transition (LCT) from a geographical perspective. We conducted a semi-systematic review to define a ‘spatially just’ low carbon transition, considering how spatial dimensions are explicitly or implicitly presented in assessments of the LCT, and the policy and governance approaches that could embed spatial justice. A sample of 75 academic articles was thematically coded. Spatial justice involves the fair distribution of both benefits and burdens associated with LCTs, and this often creates problems of equity given the geographic gap between regions that ‘win and lose’. The studies point to a research gap in exploring fairness implications that go beyond the employment impacts of transition. Acceptance of the LCT is shown to be contingent on perceptions of justice, particularly whether the most responsible and capable actors are taking action. There is similar concern that the LCT may not address, or may reproduce, existing patterns of injustice. This is particularly the case in terms of spatially inequitable land uses and where historic planning policy has had lasting socioeconomic impacts. Policy challenges to making LCTs more spatially just included administrative fragmentation across spatial scales and the lack of coordination in net zero policy. We identify that future transition policymaking could benefit from using spatially targeted interventions, and in adopting a whole systems approach. In this recognition of the multiple economic vulnerabilities of different regions, LCT policymaking can become both more effective and, critically, more just.",2022

Recognising that climatic risks attenuate this water availability, various adaptation options have been implemented in the water sector. To inform adaptation prioritisation, it is critical to assess the growing literature on adaptation options related to water management and synthesise lessons on which options are feasible and under what conditions. We assess the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in the water sector at the global scale using two examples: strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in rural areas (e.g. drip irrigation, watershed management), and sustainable water management in urban areas (e.g. flood management, upgrading sewage systems). To contextualise the assessment and showcase how adaptation feasibility is regionally differentiated, we present two case studies: flood management in Jakarta and Rotterdam; and community-based watershed management in India and the Dry Corridor of Central America, specifically Guatemala and Honduras. The assessment highlights that while improving irrigation efficiency is technically feasible and has economic benefits, it is constrained by issues of replicability and trade-offs across scale and institutional barriers. In urban areas, flood management measures are technologically and geophysically feasible but barriers such as inadequate institutional capacities constrain their feasibility. We also assess mitigation and sustainable development synergies and trade-offs for the two adaptation options. The findings on factors constraining adaptation feasibility in the water sector are useful for policymakers who are increasingly faced with a diverse suite of adaptation choices.",2020

For over fifteen years Australian Governments have been investing in programs to promote the voluntary adoption of agricultural practices that reduce nutrient, pesticide and sediment runoff. Insights from monitoring, modelling and research have been used to progressively refine and focus investments over time. Despite this, progress is clearly inadequate to achieve the ambitious program targets. More recently, policy makers have introduced new targets to enhance the active engagement of communities and land managers in programs to improve water quality outcomes. In this review article, we draw on the empirical evidence from the social science literature available from studies within the Great Barrier Reef catchments and consider implications for the current approach being used in Reef programs. Adopting a qualitative evidence synthesis approach, the review examines a nested set of themes: from landholder decision making on practice adoption; participation and engagement in programs; and the influence of the broader policy settings and instruments to deliver government plans and investment. The review highlights the influence of factors such diverse landholder goals and motivations, social and cultural risks of participation, and the benefits of knowledge exchange over knowledge transfer in building trust and commitment amongst landholders. The review also highlights the importance of maintaining collaboration and capacity in industry and natural resource management networks, and, committing to active experimentation and learning at both the farm and program levels.

However, restoring coupled human-natural systems requires integration across many science, technology, engineering, management, and governance topics that are presently fragmented. Here, we synthesized 544 peer-reviewed articles published through September 2020 on the desiccation and nascent recovery of Lake Urmia in northwest Iran. We answered nine questions of scientific and popular interest about causes, impacts, stabilization, recovery, and next steps. We find: (1) Expansion of irrigated agriculture, dam construction, and mismanagement impacted the lake more than temperature increases and precipitation decreases. (2) Aerosols from Lake Urmia's exposed lakebed are negatively impacting human health. (3) Researchers disagree on how a new causeway breach will impact salinity, evaporation, and ecosystems in the lake's north and south arms. (4) Most researchers tried to restore to a single, uniform, government specified lake level of 1274.1 m intended to recover Artemia. (5) The Iranian government motivated and funded a large and growing body of lake research. (6) Ecological and limnological studies mostly focused on salinity, Artemia, and Flamingos. (7) Few studies shared data, and only three studies reported engagement with stakeholders or managers. (8) Researchers focused on an integration pathway of climate downscaling, reservoirs, agricultural water releases, and lake level. (9) Numerous suggestions to improve farmer livelihoods and governance require implementation. We see an overarching next step for lake recovery is to couple human and natural system components. Examples include: (a) describe and monitor the system food webs, hydrologic, and human components; (b) adapt management to monitored conditions such as lake level, lake evaporation, lake salinity, and migratory bird populations; (c) improve livelihoods for poor, chronically stressed farmers beyond agriculture; (d) manage for diverse ecosystem services and lake levels; (e) engage all segments of society; (f) integrate across restoration topics while building capacity to share data, models, and code; and (g) cultivate longer-term two-way exchanges and public support.

The world continues to experience a surge in data generation and digital transformation. Historic data is increasingly being replaced by modernized data, such as big data, which is regarded as data that exhibits the 5Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value. The capacity to optimally use and comprehend value from big data has become an indispensable aptitude for modern companies. In contrast to commercial and technology firms, usage, management and governance of data, including big data is a novel and evolving trend for mining and mineral industries. Although the mining industry can be unenthusiastic to change, embracing modernized data and big data is evolutionarily unavoidable, given many industry-wide challenges (i.e., fluctuation in commodity prices, geotechnical and harsh ground conditions, and ore grade), which corrode revenues and increase business risks, including the possibility of regulatory non-compliance. The minerals industry holds a genuine gold mine of data that were collected for scientific, engineering, operational and other purposes. Data and data-centric workspaces that are targeted towards innovation and experimentation, which if combined with in-discipline expertise are two harmonious ingredients that can provide many practical solutions for the mining and mineral industries. In this paper, the concept, the opportunity and the necessity for a move towards a technology- and innovation-based, data-centric ‘dry laboratories’ (common workspaces that facilitates data-centric experimentation and innovation) in the minerals industry are assessed. We contend that the dry laboratory environment maximizes the value of data for the minerals industry. Toward the establishment of dry laboratories, we propose several essential components of a framework that would enable the functionality of dry laboratories in the minerals industry, while concomitantly examining the components from both academia and industry perspectives.",2022

Such offshore system integration is defined as the coordinated approach to planning and operation of energy generation, transport and storage in the offshore energy system, across multiple energy carriers and sectors. This article conducts a systematic literature review to identify infrastructure components of offshore energy system integration (including alternative cable connections, offshore energy storage, and power-to-hydrogen applications) and barriers to their development. An interdisciplinary perspective is provided where current offshore developments require not only mature and economically feasible technologies, but equally strong legal and governance frameworks. The findings demonstrate that current literature lacks a holistic perspective on the offshore energy system. To date, techno-economic assessments solving challenges of specific infrastructure components prevail over an integrated approach. Nevertheless, permitting issues, gaps in legal frameworks, strict safety and environmental regulations, and spatial competition also emerge as important barriers. Overall, this literature review emphasizes the necessity of aligning various disciplines to provide a fundamental approach for the development of an integrated offshore energy system. More specifically, timely policy and legal developments are key to incentivize technical development and enable economic feasibility of novel components of offshore system integration. Accordingly, to maximize real-world application and policy learning, future research will benefit from an interdisciplinary perspective.",2024

Protecting endangered species is also supported by the public and judiciary. Yet, despite what appear as enabling conditions, wild species continue to decline. Our paper explores pathways to endangered species recovery by analyzing the barriers that have been identified in Canada, the United States, and Australia. We summarize these findings based on Canada’s Species at Risk Conservation Cycle (assessment, protection, recovery planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation) and then identify 10 “bridges” that could help overcome these barriers and bend our current trajectory of wildlife loss to recovery. These bridges include ecosystem approaches to recovery, building capacity for community co-governance, linking wildlife recovery to ecosystem services, and improving our storytelling about the loss and recovery of wildlife. The focus of our conclusions is the Canadian setting, but our findings can be applied in other national and subnational settings to reverse the decline of wildlife and halt extinction.",2021

A global increase in food demand has increased the risk to food safety. Improvements in food quality, cold chain transit, and preservation are required for safe livestock products. Though, the food safety and regulation authorities demand complete food traceability from farm to fork, but in traditional supply chain it is ignored by fiddling with the transit paperwork and bill invoices. The process of supply chain reformation and activities linked to food recalls during food safety issues are insanely expensive and challenging. Traceability-driven food supply chain management is likely to implement novel technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). The capability of the Blockchain era within the food sector is emerging with use cases across different regions, as shown via the growing number of studies. Credibility, efficiency, and safety are all improved when food products can be instantly traced from their point of origin through all points of contact on their way to the consumer. Blockchain assures a tamper-proof and transparent system that allows an innovative business solution, together with smart contracts. However, there are significant difficulties with the implementation of blockchain technology for food traceability. It necessitates more and more training platforms as well as trainers, who can make understanding and operability of this technology easy among ground-level participants and food entities. For the tactical application of this technology, it is essential to comprehend the legal and regulatory framework.",2023

Forests play a key role in a bio-based economy by providing renewable materials, mitigating climate change, and accommodating biodiversity. However, forests experience massive increases in stresses in their ecological and socioeconomic environments, threatening forest ecosystem services supply. Alleviating those stresses is hampered by conflicting and disconnected governance arrangements, competing interests and claims, and rapid changes in technology and social demands. Identifying which stresses threaten forest ecosystem services supply and which factors hamper their alleviation requires stakeholders' perceptions. Stakeholder-oriented stress tests for the supply of forest ecosystem services are therefore necessary but are not yet available. This perspective presents a roadmap to develop a stress test tailored to multiple stakeholders' needs and demands across spatial scales. We provide the Cascade and Resilience Rosetta, with accompanying performance- and resilience indicators, as tools to facilitate development of the stress test. The application of the stress test will facilitate the transition toward a bio-based economy in which healthy and diverse forests provide sustainable and resilient ecosystem services.",2022

However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.",2021

Methods applied involved five stages: (1) a theoretical framework of hospital sector reforms was developed; (2) basic quantitative data characterizing hospital sectors were compared; (3) a scoping review was performed to identify an initial list of reforms per country; (4) the list was sent to national researchers who described the top three reforms based on a standardized questionnaire; (5) received questionnaires were analysed and validated with available literature. Results indicate that the scope of conducted reforms is very broad. Yet, reforms related to hospital sector governance and changes in purchasing and payment systems are much more frequent than reforms concerning relations with other providers. Most governance reforms aimed at transforming hospital infrastructure, improving financial management and/or improving quality of care, while purchasing and payment reforms focused on limiting hospital activities and/or on incentivising a shift to ambulatory/day care. Three common challenges included the lack of a comprehensive approach; unclear outcomes; and political influence.

Values and vulnerabilities evolve over the mine life cycle, forming specific territorial trajectories that depend on the initial conditions as well as on political, economic, and socio-cultural contexts. A simple graphical framework is proposed to represent and describe the changing values and vulnerabilities over the mine life cycle. This framework, which has been developed for industrial metal mines, is applicable whatever the spatial scale considered and emphasises the complexity of territorial trajectories in relation to local governance and policies. It allows for easy comparison of mining regions. Future work should focus on defining integrative indexes for the different types of territorial values and vulnerabilities.",2021

This review paper explains the institutional arrangements for water supply and on-farm water management along with their roles. Successful elements covering decades of efforts have also been studied. The implications of less profitability of the farming business are also identified. This paper articulates multiple investments for irrigation infrastructure expansion, on-farm water management, and promotion of resource conservation technologies including public sector demonstration and research projects, cost-sharing/subsidized schemes, and technology introduction with associated training and learning approaches. This draws a clear picture of present-day agriculture and has helped in identifying cracks in the implementation of these practices that need mending for more definitive outcomes. These efforts have resulted in considerable enhancements including, increasing water availability, cropped areas and cropping intensity, promotion of resource conservation technologies, and farm mechanization. Despite these attempts, farming is no more a profitable business for the majority of farmers while water productivity remains the lowest in the region. There is a constant decline of the share of agriculture sector and labor in gross domestic product of the country. The divide between on-farm water management and irrigation departments, requires formulation of a new governance model keeping in view the past experiences to make farming a profitable business.",2021

This review aims to comprehensively analyze the Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) model, which connects local food producers directly with consumers. By exploring participation factors, sustainable practices, challenges, economic impacts, and social benefits, this study seeks to provide a thorough understanding of SFSCs. Addressing gaps in existing research, the review aims to guide policymakers and practitioners in fostering sustainable, resilient, and inclusive local food systems.
Design/methodology/approach
A systematic literature review of 92 research articles was conducted following a well-defined research protocol.
Findings
The review revealed that factors driving the adoption of SFSCs include increasing consumer demand for local and sustainable products, resilience-building in the food system, and environmental concerns. The SFSC supply chain was categorized into four critical stages: food sourcing and production, processing, aggregation, and distribution and review examined the sustainable practices at each stage. However, challenges such as information asymmetry, lack of infrastructure, regulatory barriers, and market dynamics hinder the full potential of SFSCs. Economically, SFSCs contribute to local economic development and empowerment of small-scale producers, while also showing promise in reducing environmental footprints and fostering community engagement.
Research implications
The study identifies several research avenues to further advance the understanding of SFSCs. Future research should delve into consumer behavior and attitudes towards SFSCs, analyze the full sustainability impacts of SFSCs using integrated assessment methodologies, and extend the study to different regional contexts. Additionally, investigating policy interventions and governance mechanisms that can support the growth and resilience of SFSCs will be crucial for promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
Originality/value
This review contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and systematic overview of SFSCs, addressing gaps left by previous review studies. The study's findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders seeking to enhance the adoption and support of SFSCs in contemporary food systems.",2024

In 2016, the United Nations announced 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) as part of the 2030 agenda. SDG 17 is “Partnerships for the goals” highlighting the importance of cross-country and cross-company collaborative action. Although the link between CNs and sustainable development is frequently declared, no study in the literature investigates the connection between CNs and the SDGs. This systematic literature review (SLR) follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the SLR results, a context-interventions-mechanisms-outcomes (CIMO) framework for CNs is proposed, serving as a tool to comprehend the types of CNs to achieve the SDGs. Only 10 out of 77 articles mentioned the SDGs they address. The norm is to focus on a single SDG per study and not assess the dimension of the impact on the SDGs or the trade-offs that can be established between them. The most frequently mentioned SDGs in the text are SDG 9 and SDG 12, with only 2 articles focusing on the social dimension. SDG 10 and SDG 16 were not mentioned in any of the articles. The majority of articles are case studies and technical papers, developing scale-up solutions and creating value from waste. The identified gaps lead to the proposition of several potential research areas: 1) the need for developing mechanisms that allow CNs to effectively implement interventions that achieve specific SDGs; 2) the lack of studies incorporating the social dimension given the social nature of the SDGs; 3) few SDGs are addressed by CNs (particularly SDG 9 and SDG 12) and majority of SDGs are ignored; 4) there is a scarcity of studies targeting the tertiary sector; 5) the need for alignment of CNs' business models with the SDGs; 6) a lack of studies addressing specific SDGs (6, 10, and 16); and 7) the necessity of studies demonstrating collaboration between industry and academia for systemic change. The study aids decision-makers in identifying policies that facilitate the formation of CNs aligned with the SDGs.",2024

Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing ‘planetary public health’. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.",2023

There is a need to deepen insights on the characteristics of the emergent phenomenon of nature-based living labs, with respect to their predecessors. Accordingly, the paper first develops an outline of how living labs evolved into nature-based living labs, informed by bibliometric analysis. Second, the unique characteristics of nature-based living labs are identified using a systematic literature review. Finally, the core characteristics of living labs are determined, and nature-based living labs are placed within this context. Initial living labs had a strong technological focus, which proliferated into diverse application domains and regions after the European Network of Living Labs was established and expanded. Urban living labs emerged as a significant multidisciplinary and geographically specific domain, while nature-based living labs are inherently sustainability-oriented and consider ecosystem processes, interactions, and natural materials. Next, the paper identifies nine characteristics of nature-based living labs, five of which are always present, namely: (i) real-life spatial context and multi-scale, (ii) innovation and learning, (iii) user-centric, (iv) multi-actor involvement and (v) sustainability-oriented multiple benefits. Then, the four core characteristics of living labs, the variation within these characteristics, and how these align with the characteristics of nature-based living labs are clarified.

Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented.

This is matched by rapid growth in scholarship on sociotechnical transitions and energy justice, combined in the phrase ‘just transitions’. Yet how can an abstract concern with a normative concept like justice be brought to bear on the socio-technical complexities of specific changes in energy infrastructure? This is an important and timely question to consider in a practical sense, since the energy policy landscape is increasingly focused on a ‘just transition’ as combining decarbonisation and a progressive vision of social equity and justice. Our synthesis review argues that a focus on the alleviation of energy poverty – a condition whereby people are unable to secure adequate levels of energy services in the home – can enable policy-oriented mobilisation of energy justice as an integral component of evolving energy infrastructure. We approach energy poverty as an opportunity to constructively broach issues of justice in global energy policy discourse, not as a catch-all for wider injustices and vulnerabilities. We present a conceptual framework, applied to three schematic cases of energy infrastructure under transition. In and across these cross-sectoral cases, we reflect on scope for energy poverty alleviation.",2023

Recent data breaches demonstrate the superior security of blockchain-based credit reporting over conventional server-based reporting. Blockchain-based systems enable the faster, more cost-effective, and more customised issuance of digital securities. With its adoption, the market for investors can be expanded, costs for issuers can be reduced, and counterparty risk can be reduced due to the ability to customise digital financial instruments to the demands of investors. It uses mutualised standards, protocols, and shared procedures to give network users a single common source of truth. Participants in the business network can now more easily collaborate, manage data, and agree with this technology’s application.",2022

As this topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines, there is a need to synthesize and categorize these diverse contributions to inspire future investigations of emerging or under-researched substantive areas. This article addresses this need by reviewing existing research on supply chain transparency and offers an integrated understanding of this growing literature. By analyzing a sample of over 300 peer-reviewed articles through bibliometric and automated text mining methods, we identify six distinct clusters that represent substantive literature subdomains: transparency technologies, knowledge integration, governance, sustainability, traceability, and resilience. Building on these structured analyses, we develop a literature framework to comprehensively organize insights from these clusters and illustrate the conceptual relationships between transparency management systems, transparency vehicles, and transparency outcomes. By providing a holistic examination of how supply chain transparency is enabled, our framework aids researchers' future studies and guides practitioners’ strategies to identify, diagnose, and address modern challenges that face supply chains (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, workplace exploitation, increased third-party scrutiny).",2021

In recent years, policymakers, international energy, and environmental organizations have posited that advancements in information and communication technology, digitalization, renewable energy, and financial development can facilitate a smoother and quicker transition toward a greener and smarter global economy. This study employs the Panel Vector Auto-Regression model to evaluate this assertion across the top ten most polluted countries from 1995 to 2018. The empirical findings indicate that while individual indicators of information and communication technology have mixed impacts, the utilization of a digitalization-based principal component analysis index provides strong evidence of digitalization's positive effect on environmental quality. Additionally, the results suggest that renewable energy and the economic complexity index also contribute to environmental improvement. Therefore, the empirical evidence underscores the significant role of digitalization, information and communication technology, and renewable energy in enhancing environmental sustainability in the most polluted countries. Moreover, the findings indicate that although a financial development shock initially worsens environmental quality in the first year, it leads to improvements from the second year onwards. These empirical insights offer various policy recommendations regarding information and communication technology, digitalization, renewable energy, and financial development, which could support the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.",2024

While Malaysia sets its target to achieve 18 % of total primary supply only relying on renewable energy sources, it is expected that there will be an energy mismatch between supply and demand within the network due to the stochastic behavior of weather dependent renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar PV. Hence, energy storage system (ESS) delivers a better solution with its capability to perform power regulation or as a storage unit to manage with the intermittent generation from existing renewable sources. Therefore, this review outlines the prospect and outlook of first and second life lithium-ion energy storage in different applications within the distribution grid system which aligns with the policies present in Malaysia. This paper also highlights both technical and non-technical reviews on both energy storage technologies. Evidently, the outcome of the paper shows that the application of energy storage exhibits better performance along with the integration of renewable energy sources as compared to the present technology in the Malaysian grid system. In addition, second-life lithium-ion batteries with 80 % of remaining capacity could potentially elevate the present economic value of ESS within its service lifetime.",2023

The assessment, based on an analysis of the energy security and energy policies of Pakistan, focuses on the concepts of “Availability”, “Affordability”, “Technology”, “Governance”, and “Environment”. Twenty-two indicators, termed the Energy Security Indicators for Pakistan (ESIP), were selected. The ESIP were normalised using the z-score method and weighted based on principal component analysis (PCA). The index analysis revealed that Pakistan's energy security performance decreased between 1991 and 1999, followed by an increase until 2018. A maximum score of 8.36 was attained in 1991, and a minimum of 7.59 was achieved in 1999. During 2000–2018, the performance improved, resulting in a score of 8.29 in 2018.

Projected climate change impacts will aggravate water availability, as well as flood risks, especially in urban areas. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been identified as key concepts to defuse the expected tensions within the Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus due to their multiple benefits. In this paper, the authors outlined the theories and concepts, analyzed real-life case studies, and discussed the potential of NBS to address the future W-E-F nexus. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review on the theories of NBS that address the W-E-F nexus, and we summarized 19 representative real-life case studies to identify the current knowledge gaps and challenges. The quantitative and qualitative data was used to differentiate and discuss the direct and indirect potential benefits of NBS to the W-E-F nexus. The study further expanded on the challenges for the implementation of NBS and highlighted the growing possibilities in the context of circularity and the implementation of NBS in urban planning. It was concluded that the potential impacts of NBS on the W-E-F nexus have been identified, but the quantitative effects have not been analyzed in-depth. Moreover, indicators are mostly single-purpose and not multipurpose, as required to fully characterize the W-E-F nexus and circularity holistically.

At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of “financialisation” to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive “business models”, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.",2021

The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.",2024

By adopting natural climate solutions (NCS) such as cover crops, reduced tillage, and diverse crop rotations, farmers can increase soil C sequestration and co-benefits such as improved biodiversity. Canada is increasingly interested in better positioning farmers to adopt NCS via government cost-share programs, ecosystem marketplaces, and outreach and education initiatives. Given the policy and market-driven interest in soil C sequestration in agriculture, there is a need to advance the science–policy interface, ensuring foundational science, NCS implementation, and approaches to promote NCS are aligned. Herein, the objective is to present insights from multiple disciplines that can help build connections between soil C sequestration science and policy relevant to Canada's croplands. The method is a review of literature on soil and pedoclimate science, agricultural NCS adoption, agricultural NCS governance, and science–policy interfaces to achieve this objective. From this review, key insights underline that Canadian cropland soils do not have a homogenous history in NCS adoption and production type, nor are all regions influenced by the same contextual factors, have the same potential in C storage, or exist within the same agri-environmental conditions. Therefore, it is emphasized herein that policies that aim to enhance soil organic C in croplands should consider local context and C sequestration potential. Policies and programs implemented locally to enhance C sequestration across Canada should be complemented by nationally scalable measuring and monitoring to ensure outcomes are accounted for against climate goals. This review aims to contribute to building a common understanding of soil C sequestration in Canada's croplands and its science–policy interface. Efforts to further strengthen the science–policy interface for soil C sequestration in Canada's croplands might include greater integration and utilization of science and data from multiple disciplines, co-design and collaborative opportunities, and establishing on-the-ground test projects to explore innovation in policy and market design.",2023

Ports, as important hubs and sources of emissions have also received much attention. This paper investigated the development process of port emission reduction from earlier ‘environmental factors and energy scheduling’ to ‘low-carbon and green ports’ by conducting a systematic review and Citespace visual analysis. It can be also concluded that the policy has a great impact on the development of this research field. Meanwhile, this review found that among the emission reduction measures for ships in port, the average percentage of the energy measures potential is 25%–70%. The range of optimization operation measures is 30%–50%. There is a gap between the two measures. According to the diverse emission sources in the port, there is no significant difference (20%–60%) for the potential of measures application in land area. Therefore, before setting the reduction targets, ports need to know their emission level and establish emission inventories, as well as consider external factors (policy, economy, technology, etc.). Overall, port energy measures are the key points to achieving low and zero carbon targets. In the future, by addressing technical bottlenecks in energy use (such as hydrogen storage and maintenance), ports and ships will be able to further reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and increase their potential to reduce emissions. This paper aims to systematically review and explore the effects (experiences) and problems (challenges) of the abatement measures taken by different ports, to help low-abatement capacity ports to learn and find the measures that suit the emission reduction development most. For the choice of future energy, the port needs to analyze the corresponding policy factors and improve the abatement capacity through the integration of multiple measures, to understand the ‘zero carbon goal’ as soon as possible and make contributions to the environmental protection and ecological development of the region and world.",2023

Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) describe a sequence of events in response to stress, from the molecular initiating event until an adverse outcome, which is relevant to RA or regulatory decision-making. AOPs are one of the facilitators to integrate mechanistic data into RA, but it is urgent to increase the inclusion of the vast mechanistic knowledge available, especially for the RA of novel smart and advanced materials (AdMa) with multifunctional characteristics.

However, these interlinkages have not been examined in depth in recent discussions on urban sustainability and global urban science. This paper fills that gap by elaborating in detail the multiple links between urban sustainability and human health and by mapping research gaps at the interface of health and urban sustainability sciences. As researchers from a broad range of disciplines, we aimed to: 1) define the process of urbanization, highlighting distinctions from related concepts to support improved conceptual rigour in health research; 2) review the evidence linking health with urbanization, urbanicity, and cities and identify cross-cutting issues; and 3) highlight new research approaches needed to study complex urban systems and their links with health. This novel, comprehensive knowledge synthesis addresses issue of interest across multiple disciplines. Our review of concepts of urban development should be of particular value to researchers and practitioners in the health sciences, while our review of the links between urban environments and health should be of particular interest to those outside of public health. We identify specific actions to promote health through sustainable urban development that leaves no one behind, including: integrated planning; evidence-informed policy-making; and monitoring the implementation of policies. We also highlight the critical role of effective governance and equity-driven planning in progress towards sustainable, healthy, and just urban development.",2021

Countries in the BCLME region have responded to international calls to develop national climate change policies, adaptation strategies and plans to respond to these threats. These high-level documents recognize the need to better understand the vulnerabilities facing poor and marginalized communities in high risk areas and develop adaptive capacity to build resilience. However, small-scale fisheries are seldom explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, there is very little guidance on how vulnerability assessments should be conducted and how this information could inform adaptation planning. This paper reports on a community based, participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment methodology that was developed, tested and then applied in 15 communities in the BCLME region. The outcomes of these vulnerability assessments were then used to inform the development of local adaptation plans in five of these communities. Key findings from these local vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning processes are then presented. The discussion centers on the value, benefits and limitations of the participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment process, the need to take a holistic approach to understanding vulnerability, the ongoing and iterative nature of adaptation planning, the power of partnerships and networks, and the need to integrate community-based plans into other sector and climate change adaptation strategies and plans at all levels of governance.",2020

This review compares the adaptation of policies introduced by Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Ireland to investigate how the roles of community stakeholders interconnect with the European Union's commitment to accelerate onshore wind deployment. These mature markets view onshore wind energy as an essential contribution towards the net-zero electricity system, security of supply, and energy independence. The comparative case study highlights that the interaction between market-based and community-based approaches to wind energy development has seen the size, scale and formality of financial benefits increase while supports for small-scale community-led wind energy have been considerably reduced. The continued paradigm shift narrows the scope for community participation in wind farms and presents considerations and paradoxes regarding the role of communities in local energy transitions. Recommendations consider the need for flexibility regarding the geographic “proximity criteria” for citizen participation, approaches to include communities into the governance and disbursement of shared benefits, and the potential to encourage citizen investment into onshore wind energy.

Although the circular ecosystem represents a promising initial bridge between the circular economy literature and the business ecosystem literature, studies remain largely descriptive with a conflictive and imprecise theoretical understanding of what a circular ecosystem is and its unique features. Consequently, the literature on circular ecosystems may tend to diverge due to a proliferation of definitions, rendering the accumulation of knowledge more difficult. To address this gap, we investigate how circular ecosystems are organized and the essential elements incorporated into this type of collaborative structure. Through a systematic literature review, we present the evolution of research over time and provide a framework that synthesizes the five main and unique elements of a circular ecosystem (1. Value, 2. Actors, 3. Data, Materials and flows, 4. Circular activities and strategies, and 5. Governance). In particular, the results show that a value proposition that allows multiple cycles of value (e.g. activities that ensure materials continually returning to the industrial system) is a critical aspect of the ecosystem. Also, the actors within this structure should be balanced to ensure that the circular activities are being successfully performed. The proposed framework serves to characterize a circular ecosystem and to provide unique features that distinguish it from non-circular ecosystems. In addition, this conceptual and strategic tool helps researchers to understand how this type of structure creates and captures value and allows companies to identify ecosystem partners and enhance their circular initiatives.

Competing priorities make using a transparent and evidence-based approach important when deciding to recommend new vaccines. We conducted a literature review to document the processes and frameworks for national decision-making on new vaccine introductions and explored which key features have evolved since 2010.
Methods
We searched literature published on policymaking related to vaccine introduction from March 2010 to August 2020 in six databases. We screened articles for eligibility with the following exclusion criteria: non-human or hypothetical vaccines, the sole focus on economic evaluation or decision to adopt rather than policy decision-making. We employed nine broad categories of criteria from the 2012 review for categorization and abstracted data on the country, income level, vaccine, and other relevant criteria.
Results
Of the 3808 unique references screened, 116 met eligibility criteria and were classified as: a) framework of vaccine adoption decision-making (27), b) studies that analyse empirical data on or examples of vaccine adoption decision-making (45), c) theoretical and empirical articles that provide insights into the vaccine policymaking process (44 + 17 already included in the previous categories). Commonly reported criteria for decision-making were the burden of disease; vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, safety; impact on health and non-health outcomes; economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions. Programmatic and acceptability aspects were not as often considered. Most (50; 82%) of the 61 articles describing the process of vaccine introduction policymaking highlighted the role of country, regional, or global evidence-informed recommendations and a robust national governance as enabling factors for vaccine adoption.
Conclusions
The literature on vaccine adoption decision-making has expanded since 2010. We found that policymakers and expert advisory committee members (e.g., National Immunization Technical Advisory Group [NITAG]) increasingly value the interventions based on economic evaluations. The results of this review could guide discussions on evidence-informed immunization decision-making among country, sub-regional, and regional stakeholders.",2021

However, considering the diversity that occurs across the country in every social, and ecological aspect it is essential to understand the cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of the country to determine more efficient agricultural practices to improve the resilience of the agricultural systems in a particular region. To achieve this objective, numerous traditional methods can be employed in modern farming strategies in order to make it more nature-friendly. Therefore, this literature review was developed to provide insights for the development of an evidence-based framework to enhance the climate resilience of Sri Lanka's agricultural systems. In that aspect, 36 scientific communications were considered over 13 years, using articles from the Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases (2010–2023). In addition, 4 country papers, and publications from the UN, ADB, FAO, and IPCC were cited. In this literature review article, the relationship between agriculture and climate change was identified. Then, the climate-resilient ability of traditional agriculture and its location specificity were reviewed. The status of climate resilience in the existing food system was analyzed considering the Batticaloa farming system as a case study. Finally, an appropriate location-specific framework was suggested to build climate resilience by integrating traditional farming techniques into modern agriculture. As per the results, rainwater harvesting strategies as cascade village tank system, management of limited water through practices as shared cultivation (Bethma govithena), shared responsibility (Pangukariya) for the maintenance of village tanks, dry seed paddy farming (Kekulam govithena), maintaining agro-biodiversity via, mixed cropping, agro-forestry, use of resistant crop varieties are the key Sri Lankan traditional agricultural practices which can be adapted to build the system resilience. These practices are developed based on the specific cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of each region of the country. However, the establishment of micro-irrigation systems, utilizing early warning systems, development of high-yielding resistant crop varieties, crop-livestock integration, and cultivation of location-specific crop varieties are the main modern agricultural practices recommended to build up the climate resilience of the food systems. However, many of these recommended practices were exercised during the traditional agricultural systems as well. There are many other specific practices available that can be applied with modification even for present-day agriculture to enhance its climate resilience. Integrating the knowledge from traditional agriculture into modern agricultural practices will directly facilitate the achievement of three sustainable development goals of climate action, zero hunger, and no poverty through the development of regional-specific sustainable agricultural practices that restore the resilience of agriculture. Therefore, this literature review article proposes a framework for managing location-specific climate-resilient food systems on par with the regional agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of Sri Lanka.",2024

At the turn of the 21st century, many spatial planning models, technological trends, environmental challenges, and socio-economic realities are influencing African cities’ dynamics largely causing confusion and a lack of consistent planning policies. To efficiently guide a coherent and coordinated vision, frame an integrated long-term spatial logic, and give a precise direction for sustainable urban development, this paper aims to develop a localized and contextualised analysis of urban planning challenges and development strategies shaping African cities. The study provides a broad perspective looking at the potentiality of spatial planning practices to envision and transform urban life by prospecting integrated urban planning and development strategies to face increasing urban challenges in Africa. Through Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and machine-learning tools, the study brings, for the first time, consolidated and updated knowledge of urban planning practices in Africa. We analysed 243 urban studies, published between 2000 and 2023, in 107 African cities. We identified and scrutinised 17 most pressing urban challenges and 16 most applied urban strategies to address those challenges. Accordingly, the study’s findings suggest shifting the spatial planning paradigm towards urban resilience as an interoperable system of different spatial planning policies and their relevant urban development strategies. Furthermore, the study’s key arguments are to improve urban infrastructure and optimize existing cities to reverse environmental degradation and guide urban fast transformation to adapt and mitigate growing climate change catastrophes.",2024

However, a state-of-the-art review of critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing blockchain technology in the construction industry is unexplored. In addition, there is no stage framework or a common set of CSFs for blockchain technology in the extant literature. Therefore, this review study aims to develop a stage framework and identify a common set of CSFs for successful blockchain technology implementation by analyzing published articles related to the studied domain. This review study adopted a systematic literature review and a science mapping approach to objectively identify a common set of CSFs, research gaps, and future research directions. Focusing on 78 journal articles retrieved from the Scopus database, influential journals, keywords, countries/regions, and documents in the domain of CSFs for blockchain technology in construction were analyzed. The results revealed that countries like China, USA, UK, and Australia have made the most contributions to this domain. Of the 22 CSFs, five main common sets for blockchain technology were (1) decentralized system (protocol), (2) transparency in data information for construction lifecycle processes, (3) ensuring data immutability, (4) increasing data security and reliability, and (5) providing full traceability of prefabrication. In the stage framework of CSFs for blockchain technology, some CSFs play an essential role throughout the entire construction life cycle processes (e.g., CSF#1 decentralized system and CSF#2 transparency in data information for construction life cycle processes). Four key research gaps and future research directions are proposed.

Achieving rapid, sensitive detection of contaminants is extremely important for timely environmental pollution monitoring and treatment. Quantum dot (QD) probes have become a common method for the detection of contaminants. In particular, the development of QDs based on nonmetallic element-doped carbon materials QDs and other nonmetallic doped Si QDs, MoOx QDs, MoS2 QDs, and MXene QDs provides a more convenient and effective means of detecting pollutants. However, a comprehensive summary of the application of nonmetal-doped QD probes for contaminant detection is still lacking. To address this issue, in the present work we mainly categorize different nonmetal-doped QDs into “top-down” and “bottom-up” strategies based on their preparation methods. QD probes based on nonmetal doping have unique optical properties, such as a narrow excitation spectrum, optical tunability, high fluorescence quantum yield (QY), and fluorescence stability. Fluorescence sensing technology can be realized through sensing mechanisms such as fluorescence/dynamic quenching, photoinduced electron transfer (PET), internal filtering effect (IFE), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Considering the ease of implementation, operation, and immediate response of fluorescence sensing technology, it has been widely used in research for the detection of environmental pollutants. We have found that fluorescence sensing technology based on nonmetal-doped QD probes can achieve rapid detection of pollutants (such as heavy metals in water or food, harmful nonmetallic ions, organic pesticides, and antibiotic residues), and its limit of detection (LOD) can reach the picomolar level for trace detection. In addition, the fluorescence sensing technology of nonmetallic QD probes can be combined with smart devices to realize real-time monitoring of pollutants. Our work provides additional strategies for developing nonmetal-doped QD probe-based detection of contaminants and advancing future environmental governance.",2023

But how these evolutionary pathways can affect an urban growth model is unclear. This review paper offers a synthesis of the current philosophy of a FEW nexus in connection with the realm of urban growth models (UGMs) to signify the paradigm collision and shift with interdisciplinary sustainability insights. Findings indicate that urban metabolism and urban ecology in relation to FEW sectors can be incorporated into UGMs with scales via multicriteria decision analysis as FEW technology hub integration can play a critical role in UGMs via a common cellular automata (CA) architecture for both model construction and solution procedure. Synergies between FEW sectors and CA-based UGMs as well as tradeoffs across FEW technology hub integration are highlighted to reflect the cascade effects and higher order impact on urban metabolism and urban ecology. This concept was confirmed with a case study in Miami, Florida, the United States for demonstration. Such synergistic framework is helpful for fostering more sustainable, green, smart, forward-looking, environmentally-sound, socially equitable, risk-informed, resilient, and cost-effective urban growth simulations. It is anticipated that the proposed hybrid FEW-CA-based UGMs can fully account for interactions of context- and culture-driven issues for multi-scale and multiagent urban planning and design in different countries.",2020

Thus, advances in blockchain technology are increasingly investigated as a viable digital technology to address such problems. This advantage has led to blockchain gaining significant traction within the AEC industry thus piquing the interests of researchers. Although prior reviews on blockchain have been well appreciated, those studies do not give a complete picture of blockhain in the AEC industry as a whole. For example, whereas some researchers focused their studies on the construction industry, others did so across multiple domains. And researchers who attempted to review blockchain in the AEC industry employed a qualitative methodology which have been criticized for its lack of reproducibility and susceptibility to subjective biases. Moreover, those studies which utilized a quantitative approach employed a single science mapping tool for its analysis, which did not meet the criteria for a robust science mapping research. Therefore, there is the need for further review research efforts to supplement the limitations of the previous works. Thus, this study presents a robust science-mapping based analysis of the state-of-the art research on blockchain technology in the AEC industry, by combining three scientometric tools to analyze quantitatively, 12,549 relevant bibliographic data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The results revealed that blockchain can be used as an optimization technology to optimize processes, systems, activities, and decision-making in the AEC industry.

Current European (EU) policies, such as the Green Deal, envisage safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) practices for the management of chemicals, which cogently entail nanomaterials (NMs) and advanced materials (AdMa). These practices, applied at the earliest stages of innovation and throughout the life-cycle of chemicals, materials and products, could prevent and/or minimise their environmental, health and safety (EHS) and sustainability impacts. This requires a shift from the established risk control paradigms towards prevention-based approaches at the design stage that accelerate the development of safer and more sustainable chemicals, materials, products and processes, while promoting a transition towards a circular economy and a more sustainable future. The EU commission has funded several Horizon 2020 projects applying the concepts of SSbD to nanotechnologies, biotechnologies and advanced materials. This article is inspired from the answers and opinions shared during a stakeholders meeting arranged throughout the workshop entitled ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design Paradigms applied to NMs and AdMa’, held in Venice, Italy, in September 2022. The goal of the workshop was to identify differences and overlaps between the SSbD approaches and to provide common messages on the progress towards the implementation of concrete SSbD concepts, and to reveal challenges faced in their realistic and straightforward execution. In this article, we provide insights into the intersecting industrial domains, the technical and organisational challenges to the practical implementation of the SSbD, and future financial directions in supporting and maintaining the digital products currently under development within the H2020 projects, in order to ultimately enable their uptake by industry and regulators.",2023

In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have been dedicated to exploring the applications of blockchain and privacy computing technologies in the process of data value release. Scholars have discovered that the combination of the two technologies can alleviate many pain points of each other. Specifically, privacy computing is a computational theory and method for protecting privacy of information throughout its lifecycle. Privacy computing enables the processing, analysis, and computation of data while preserving the confidentiality of the original information. Nevertheless, challenges related to data ownership and benefit distribution impede the establishment of a fair and effective collaborative environment among multiple parties, thereby restricting its further practical development. On the other hand, blockchain is a technology for establishing a trusted platform among mutually untrusted parties, characterized by decentralization, immutability, traceability, and incentive mechanisms. However, blockchain also faces security issues such as transparency of on-chain data and lack of protection in smart contract execution environments. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively analyze and explore the integration of blockchain and privacy computing from both perspectives, focusing on bidirectional utilization.

At the same time, systems thinking as a ‘buzz-word’ has gained relevance for approaching complex problem areas in all kinds of disciplines including those preoccupied with the subsurface. This paper reviews the literature about urban underground planning through a systems-lens. To set this in context, it is outlined how organizational principles for the urban subsurface have evolved, and the main aspects of systems thinking are introduced followed by a discussion of how this thinking could be applied to the urban underground. Strategies and tools presented in the recent literature in the field are then reviewed based on this perspective, asking how systemic the proposed strategies and tools are when the local geology, as well as legal and institutional settings are accepted as a baseline for analysis or intervention. Systemic approaches built on this premise have the potential to capture existing and evolving complexities, foster a better understanding of the value of subsurface space for a city and ultimately enable an efficient and fair allocation of underground space. However, propositions for holistic solutions remain dispersed, interventions often remain based in an engineering mindset, and a shift in mind-set remains a challenge.

Innovative models of health care that involve advanced technology in the form of a digital hospital are emerging globally. Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings.
Aim
The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings.
Design
Scoping review.
Data sources
Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias.
Results
Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool.
Conclusions
While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

Concerns have been raised, however, about the potential risks that wastewater surveillance might pose towards group privacy. Existing scholarship has focused upon using ethics- or human rights-based frameworks as a means of balancing the public health objectives of wastewater surveillance and the potential risks it might pose to group privacy. However, such frameworks greatly lack enforceability. In order to further the strong foundation laid by such frameworks – while addressing their lack of enforceability – this paper proposes the idea of the ‘obligation’ as an alternative way to regulate wastewater surveillance systems. The legal codification of said obligations provides a method of ensuring that wastewater surveillance systems can be deployed effectively and equitably. Our paper proposes that legal obligations for wastewater surveillance can be created and enforced through transparent and purposeful legislation (which would include limits on power and grant institutions substantial oversight) as well as paying heed to non-legislative legal means of enforcement, such as through courts or contracts. Introducing legal obligations for wastewater surveillance could therefore be highly useful to researchers, policymakers, corporate technologists, and government agencies working in this field.",2024

Wetlands provide ∼$47.4 trillion/year worth of ecosystem services globally and support immense biodiversity, yet face widespread drainage and pollution, and large-scale wetlands restoration is urgently needed. Payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes provide a viable avenue for funding large-scale wetland restoration. However, schemes around the globe differ substantially in their goals, structure, challenges, and effectiveness in supporting large-scale wetland restoration. Here, we suggest wetland-based PES schemes use common asset trusts (CATs) to build investment portfolios of wetlands across landscapes that sustain and enhance overall provision of multiple ecosystem services. CATs can meet the needs of multiple investors, permit bundled payments, and provide flexibility to invest in the restoration of numerous services/values, all using a coordinated, highly collaborative, prioritized, and transparent process. CATs would support financial viability, facilitate efficiency to reduce administrative burdens, and enable credibility and social licence building to restore wetland values and services globally.",2021

Buildings are a major primary energy consumer in the world energy sector, with a value of about 40% of total energy consumption. The absence of traditional sources of energy currently promotes the development of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). The general definition of net zero energy construction is very critical to grasp. The aim of the paper is to overview the literature on the existing NZEB to make them self-sustaining and net zero in order to improve energy efficiency of the buildings. If enough renewable energy could be used, NZEB could potentially be achievable with power production. Furthermore, different building-service systems utilizing renewable energy sources have been extensively investigated for possible uses in NZEB. The paper gives the detail of its climatic condition in various part of the world along with their consequences and its impacts. The NZEB concept will significantly define the demand and supply strategies for renewable energies and conversion accounting to achieve a NZEB target along with its renewable energy evaluation. Buildings account for a large proportion of the world's total energy and carbon emissions, and play an important role in formulating strategies for sustainable growth. To this end, smart systems implement applications with numerous and interdisciplinary features. Here, the paper gives a detailed literature review on NZEB.",2022

It is important to understand how different factors are interlinked to influence the business owners’/managers’ decisions for sustainability. Therefore, the gap between policies and their implementation in the workplace causes the failure of the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. To provide a clear picture, the present study intends to investigate the factors that might foster/hinder the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. The study provides a systematic literature review on sustainable business policies from 2015 to 2023. We consider what are the key factors supporting or obstructing the successful implementation of a sustainability framework in the business practices in SMEs. Our findings reveal that data-centered solutions, sensor aided cyber physical systems, green consumption, vendor support, technological roadmap, gain legitimacy on the use of data analytics, and acceleration of digital transformation are the most significant enablers for sustainable business practices in SMEs. In addition, cloud enterprise resource planning is found to be the most significant enabler for developing countries. The barriers are mainly related to the implantation of the enablers. Among those major barriers are security of the data storage, lack of trust, lack of top management support, resistance to change to the new technology, lack of skilled workforce, data breaches, and poor network security. Our findings have key policy implications for practitioners and policy makers.",2024

Acknowledging this, urban climate change adaptation and mitigation plans are increasingly developed to make progress toward enhancing climate resilience. While there is consensus that focusing on both adaptation and mitigation is necessary for addressing climate change impacts, better understanding of their interactions is needed to efficiently maximize their potentials. This paper, first, provides a bibliographic analysis to map existing knowledge regarding adaptation-mitigation interactions. This is done using methods such as bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. Then, drawing on the literature, this study explores two types of interactions between adaptation and mitigation measures, namely co-benefits and synergies. These interactions are explored through analyzing evidence reported in the literature on different measures related to sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, water, green infrastructure, urban planning, and governance. Results of the bibliographic analysis show that there is a lack of research in the Global South. Results of the detailed content analysis show that many measures can provide co-benefits and synergies. Measures related to green infrastructure, buildings, energy systems, and, transportation are particularly capable of providing co-benefits. In addition, it was found that appropriate levels of density, promotion of public transportation, and urban greenery are measures that are more likely to provide synergistic benefits if combined with other adaptation and/or mitigation measures. This study highlights the need for more empirical research to better understand the magnitude of synergistic benefits between different measures.",2021

In all rice-growing environments, the yield gap (the difference between the potential yield in irrigated lowland or water-limited yield in rainfed lowland and upland and the actual yield obtained by farmers) is largely due to a wide range of constraints including water-related issues. This paper aims to review water management research for rice cultivation in SSA. Major water-related constraints to rice production include drought, flooding, iron toxicity, and soil salinity. A wide range of technologies has been tested by Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) and its partners for their potential to address some of the water-related challenges across SSA. In the irrigated lowlands, the system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying significantly reduced water use, while the pre-conditions to maintain grain yield and quality compared to continuous flooding were identified. Salinity problems caused by the standing water layer could be addressed by flushing and leaching. In the rainfed lowlands, water control structures, Sawah rice production system, and the Smart-Valleys approach for land and water development improved water availability and grain yield compared to traditional water management practices. In the rainfed uplands, supplemental irrigation, mulching, and conservation agriculture mitigated the effects of drought on rice yield. The Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) approach was developed to work with and educate communities to help them implement improved water management technologies. Most of the research assessed a few indicators such as rice yield, water use, water productivity at the field level. There has been limited research on the cost-benefit of water management technologies, enabling conditions and business models for their large-scale adoption, as well as their impact on farmers’ livelihoods, particularly on women and youth. Besides, limited research has been conducted on water management design for crop diversification, landscape-level water management, and iron toxicity mitigation, particularly in lowlands. Filling these research gaps could contribute to sustainable water resources management and sustainable intensification of rice-based systems in SSA.",2022

Despite sheep in dry areas being capable of surviving relatively long periods with little water, deficiency of this essential nutrient produces lightweight carcasses and dark, dry and less tender meat. Responses to impacts of water scarcity have often been reactive rather than proactive, focusing on crisis rather than risk management. To effectively minimise the impact of water scarcity on dryland sheep meat production and quality, water-scarce countries should adopt a new paradigm for water management aimed at risk reduction. This entails identification and adoption of a menu of local recovery and resilience interventions spanning the spectrum from management of water, feed and animals to human resources capacitation. Most of the existing recovery and resilience strategies in water-scarce sheep producing countries have, however, not been widely adopted due to lack of evidence, resources, and adaptive capacity. The current review, therefore, discusses the impacts of water scarcity on sheep meat production and quality, and identifies a portfolio of local recovery and resilience strategies for adoption by dryland countries.",2021

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified.

Embracing a DT framework can enable the visualization of interdependencies within civil systems, facilitating the prediction of interventions to mitigate future climate change impacts. Therefore, the scope of this review was to determine how UM results are represented to end users, such as architects, and engineers and evaluate if these methods align with industry practices. Initially, we analyzed 70 UM studies to investigate the methods and visualization techniques employed. Trends revealed minimal integration of UM with Industry 4.0 technologies or DTs. The findings underscored a lack of dynamic and geographically oriented visualization in UM, with static representation methods like bar charts and Sankey diagrams prevailing, and mostly disconnected from the geographical location of the flows represented. Consequently, the research was further expanded to explicitly review the use of emerging technologies from Industry 4.0, including DTs, using targeted words. An extended review showed a gap in the integration of the UM framework with DT technologies, although an increased use in mapping was depicted. There was inconsistency in the adoption of specific technologies or visualization methods, highlighting ongoing research in this area. The increased use of geographic information system (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) marked a pivotal change for more elaborate mapping of UM outcomes. Limited application of dynamic visualizations in UM persists, with MFA diagrams, Sankey diagrams, and bar charts being commonly used methods, despite the need to develop such type of visualizations in the sustainability field. There is an obvious lack of interoperability of these methods with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software as well as Building Information Model (BIM) software, which are standard tools in urban planning and design. This limitation is particularly significant in environments where the ability to modify planning scenarios and work with precise spatial representations is crucial. We argue that UM can be more effective if integrated with technologies such as DT, which can resolve the spatial issue and describe UM contextualizing it and potentially depicting it in real-time. Additionally, DTs can offer promising solution by integrating UM analysis results and facilitating modifications to the 3-dimensional environment based on this information. This capability empowers planners and designers to conduct simulations, update UM analyses, and iterate the design process, aligning with contemporary practices in planning and design. Given the interdisciplinary nature of UM, which includes various concepts such as urban flows, city flows, system of systems, and urban networks, our study deliberately focuses solely on UM and its associated frameworks. This targeted approach may limit the breadth of concepts explored, but it ensures depth and coherence in our analysis of UM for this study.",2024

In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context.

In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts.

For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.",2021

These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology. Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real. The exploration revealed that due to the exponential uses of blockchain, investments involved, and a number of start-up businesses contributing to Industry 4.0, blockchain indeed has a credible potential in the construction industry.",2020

Urban nature could benefit from the implementation of technology to enhance nature experiences and nature's impact on the community. This study aims to review and synthesise existing literature focusing on the associations between digital placemaking, mental health and wellbeing impact and the use of green and blue spaces while exploring successful case studies. Hundred and seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria, most of them used qualitative methods. The findings provide insights into the potential impact of digital placemaking practices for urban nature on citizens’ wellbeing and mental health. Our results indicated an absence of agreement on the concept of digital placemaking, and a lack of blue space research while nature was presented as a context and passive element. Mental health and wellbeing are mostly approached without specifically examining health indicators or assessing the health impact of these practices. Our study proposes a model offering insights into the broad range of best practices for implementing digital placemaking for nature and wellbeing and represents a key contribution to understanding the innovative application of augmenting NBS through digital placemaking impacting the wellbeing of citizens.",2023

Their synthesis currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 60% of all polymers are produced for single-use. Examples include shopping bags, packaging materials, mulch films, and soluble polymers for cosmetics and other purposes. Currently, only a portion of single-use plastic is recycled or disposed of in incinerators or landfills. An estimated 20% is not disposed of properly and pollutes the global environment, especially the oceans. In response to these challenges, the United Nations, European Union, and many nation-states are developing regulatory frameworks that encourage the chemical industry to produce plastics with a smaller environmental footprint and often support this through research funding. Possible solutions include: (1) the use of green energy, green hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks, or CO2 in synthesis; (2) the reuse or recycling of plastics through conversion or pyrolysis; and (3) the production of biodegradable polymers. The German chemical industry contributes approximately one-third of polymer production in the EU. It is embedded in the EU regulatory and research landscape and anchored in the European Green Deal, which aims for carbon neutrality by 2050. In this paper, we describe how BASF and Evonik, two leading German chemical companies with strong but different polymer portfolios, respond to the call for greener polymers and how technologies are being developed to make polyurethanes, a particularly important and difficult-to-recycle family of elastomers and duromers, renewable and circular. Reducing the environmental footprint of plastics requires not only innovative materials but also proper governance, regulatory and collection systems, and public willingness to cooperate. In an international comparison of these competencies, expressed by the ""polymer management index"" (PMI), Germany achieved a top position.",2024

Given the differences in the degree of social development, resource endowment and technological level, each country should build a carbon-neutral plan based on its national conditions. Compared with other major developed countries (e.g., Germany, the United States and Japan), China's carbon neutrality has much bigger challenges, including a heavy and time-pressured carbon reduction task and the current energy structure that is over-dependent on fossil fuels. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of the key technologies for low-carbon, near-zero carbon, and negative carbon emissions. Technological innovations associated with coal, oil-gas and hydrogen industries and their future potential in reducing carbon emissions are particularly explained and assessed. Based on integrated analysis of international experience from the world's major developed countries, in-depth knowledge of the current and future technologies, and China's energy and ecological resources potential, five lessons for the implementation of China's carbon neutrality are proposed: (1) transformation of energy production pattern from a coal-dominated pattern to a diversified renewable energy pattern; (2) renewable power-to-X and large-scale underground energy storage; (3) integration of green hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization; (4) construction of clean energy systems based on smart sector coupling (ENSYSCO); (5) improvement of ecosystem carbon sinks both in nationwide forest land and potential desert in Northwest China. This paper provides an international perspective for a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of carbon neutrality in China, and can serve as a theoretical foundation for medium-long term carbon neutral policy formulation.",2023

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently.

The theme is important because of the environmental problems caused by waste, irregular disposal, and the low recycling rates in the world, around 45%. The first round of academic production analysis through the Scopus database shows that the word challenge is strongly associated with technology and recycling. The hypothesis from this first cluster organization is that recycling is an unresolved challenge regarding cost, management, and technology. To analyze the recycling system, we use the affirmatives of circular economy in line with sustainable principles. Using data mining, we searched to collect, organize, and analyze the literature on recycling and technology. Beginning with 84.542 records and making six coupling analyses, we found that challenge, process, material, environment, and management are more closely associated with recycling and technology. There is a dominance of laboratory experiments. Researchers have offered small contributions to action alternatives to recycling. In short, we looked for the intertwining between recycling and technology in academic production and did not find this connection.

Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions—including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management—with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions.

The Government acknowledged the impossibility of universal grid electrification in the desire time frame (2025–2030). This study reviews the struggling rural off-grid initiative in South Africa to unpack effective, sustainable rural electrification approaches. It is based on a thorough evaluation of fellow African successful off-grid initiatives and the country’s energy transition that gave rise to its exiting energy landscape. It was revealed that the conventional electrification rate of 5 to 10% annual is not sufficient for the country to accomplish universal grid access by 2030. It requires a minimum of 20% electrification rate per annum at an enormous budget increase of over 200%, amounting to an excess of USD 500 million to achieve universal grid access by 2025. The following recommendations were proposed to address the existing unsustainable rural electrification practice in the country. A new energy policy that mandates the supply of 50 kWh/month electricity through renewable energy source is required. The policy should clearly stipulate incentives for local and provincial municipalities partaking in renewable energy initiatives after independently verified demand reduction. Furthermore, the new policy should also allow for innovative entrepreneurs and programmes to collaborate with said municipalities to achieve its mandate. Provision of learnerships in the Higher Education sector to support the envisaged increased need for technical expertise on renewable energy systems, optimisation, and smart metring should be enforced in the new policy. Lastly, a concerted approach to educating existing and potential consumers on the benefits of being unaffected by load shedding and control of their own demand management should be embarked on in a national drive.",2021

This assistive technology innovates information and communication development paradigms, such as directly connecting the brain and multimedia devices to the cyber world. The system converts brain information to understandable signals for multimedia devices without physical interference and replaces human-based languages with the external environment control protocols. This advancement challenges and limits security severely. For this reason, the rate of attacks, malware, ransomware, and other types of vulnerabilities is increasing drastically. Another reason is the need to improve traditional procedures to investigate cyberenvironment security aspects. Also, these malicious attackers' prime objective is to harm personal information, enable content security and privacy protocols and physical systems integrity, and create high risk between system and consumers. However, security's capital importance stems from the growing number of wearables (on-body) and in-body wireless devices. These limitations affect personal and healthcare wireless networks during the communication (such as on-chain and off-chain) between human and wearable sensors (sense and transmit) and actuators.

While research on energy transitions has generated an extensive literature, the extent to which it has used the policy innovation perspective – entailing policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success – remains unclear. This study analyzes over 8000 publications on energy transitions through a bibliometric review and computational text analysis to create an overview of the scholarship, map conceptual engagement with public policy, and identify the use of the policy innovation lens in the literature. We find that: (i) though the importance of public policy is frequently highlighted in the research, the public policy itself is analyzed only occasionally; (ii) studies focusing on public policy have primarily engaged with the concepts of policy mixes, policy change, and policy process; and (iii) the notions of policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success are hardly employed to understand the sources, speed, spread, or successes of energy transitions. We conclude that the value of the policy innovation lens for energy transitions research remains untapped and propose avenues for scholars to harness this potential.",2022

Perhaps because these spaces rely on new ways of integrating different forms of advanced computing, such as AI and VR, little is yet known about their potential ethical implications. In this contribution, we provide an overview of key themes frequently discussed in the context of these so-called Intelligent Virtual Environments (IVEs). We highlight different ethical questions and the ways in which they are typically taken up in the literature. We first map how common concerns tend to revolve around technological feasibility and psychological impacts. We then ask how shifting the focus towards more philosophical perspectives might reorient discussions surrounding IVEs, opening up important avenues for future research. Our contribution in this review is to highlight how as active mediators of experience these technologies require critical reflection and should not be evaluated solely in terms of their functionality.",2024

Thus, we systematically map the peer-reviewed literature including all perspectives, methodologies, solutions, and world regions to provide quantitative and narrative syntheses. We found that most studies focus on developed regions, with the biggest cluster on renewable energy in Europe. Worldwide, low-carbon material solutions are the least investigated, whereas behavioral issues and circular economy are rarely examined in developed regions. Economic, informational, and attitudinal aspects are tackled more often than socio-technical issues. Adoption is more frequently described in terms of enabling reasons than barriers.

This becomes even more complex when considering the rapid population growth and urban development. The development of nature-based solutions (NbS) is acknowledged as a viable strategy to address this issue. It has multiple human and environmental health benefits under both normal and extreme climatic scenarios. This study aimed to examine how different conditions and factors are linked to the development of NbS for urban climate change adaptation, with a specific focus on stormwater and flooding management. Through a systematic literature review, this study proposes a taxonomy of NbS to better understand the processes and hierarchies involved in developing NbS. The analysis covered multiple factors related to geographical focus and scale, sector, climatic conditions, adaptation and mitigation measures, ecosystem services, and co-benefits. These factors were linked to ten classified NbS approaches and 29 specific NbS interventions. An analysis of 582 empirical studies showed that Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) are the most dominant approaches of NbS for adaptation, followed by Low-Impact Development (LID), Green Infrastructure (GI), Sponge City (SC), and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). Among the different interventions, green roofs play a significant role in providing multifunctional ecosystem services and adaptation benefits such as stormwater and climate regulation.

“Advanced Materials” (AdMas) represent the next technology frontier. According to the European Union, AdMas are materials that feature a series of exceptional properties or functionalities compared to conventional materials. Considering the progress made in the design and application of AdMas, their adverse effects are still largely unknown whilst this is critical for assessing their environmental and human health risk. In this perspective, we first summarize the available definitions/descriptions and categorizations that cover AdMas and evaluate their adequacy from a toxicological point of view. We further describe the challenges and outlook on the toxicology of AdMas and propose solutions to tackle some of the challenges. Criteria related to which AdMas might induce hazards are discussed and used to propose a starting point of how to address AdMas in legal frameworks that consider human and environmental risks. Finally, we highlight the benefit of classification, e.g., enabling differentiation between AdMas based on their properties that might induce specific hazards and facilitate a faster pathway to identify the hazards of new AdMas, which is particularly relevant for safe-by-design.",2023

The process of developing a blockchain-based application that fits user requirements largely depends on the selection of a suitable consensus protocol, which acts as the centerpiece of blockchain architecture. In distributed networks, consensus protocols not only help maintain data consistency among all stakeholders, but also allow users to work together and stay secure. However, limited efforts have been delivered to analyze and compare existing consensus protocols under various construction scenarios, leading to uncertainties when applying blockchain technology in the construction domain. Therefore, this paper performs a critical review extracting literatures from (1) blockchain-based applications in the construction industry, and (2) existing blockchain consensus protocols. Additionally, a mixed method that integrates qualitative and quantitative analysis is proposed to evaluate the suitability of mainstream consensus protocols for various construction-related applications. Based on the selection criteria and efficiency requirements of consensus protocols generated, a recommendation strategy is also presented for consensus protocol selection under different construction scenarios.

Recently, the scale of the problem has been exacerbated by increases in indoor livelihood activities during lockdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study describes the effects of increased plastic waste on environmental footprint and human health. Further, the technological/regulatory options and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for sustainable plastic waste management are critically dealt in terms of their implications on energy resilience and circular economy. The abrupt increase in health-care waste during pandemic has been worsening environmental quality to undermine the sustainability in general. In addition, weathered plastic particles from PPE along with microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) can all adsorb chemical and microbial contaminants to pose a risk to ecosystems, biota, occupational safety, and human health. PPE-derived plastic pollution during the pandemic also jeopardizes sustainable development goals, energy resilience, and climate control measures. However, it is revealed that the pandemic can be regarded as an opportunity for explicit LCA to better address the problems associated with environmental footprints of plastic waste and to focus on sustainable management technologies such as circular bio-economies, biorefineries, and thermal gasification. Future researches in the energy-efficient clean technologies and circular bio-economies (or biorefineries) in concert with a “nexus” framework are expected to help reduce plastic waste into desirable directions.",2023

To safeguard these leading devices, researchers and developers adopted artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the security system. Besides, emerging AI frameworks have entirely changed the landscape of UAVs quality of experience (QoE) by contributing to diverse issues. Meanwhile, owing to the novelty of the subject, AI-based frameworks for UAVs security were not carefully surveyed.

The biodiversity perspective has been largely missing. The European Green Deal's ambitious targets have brought biodiversity and ecosystem condition restoration and conservation to the core of the EU's legislative portfolios. An opportunity to revisit some important governing texts with a biodiversity lens has therefore presented itself. In this study, we review the impacts on biodiversity and carbon emissions of specific bioenergy pathways that may be used to supply additional forest-based energy. We then synthesize our findings in a nexus matrix, plotting the pathways along a gradient of benefits through to detriments on the two dimensions to highlight win-win and lose-lose options. We found that some pathways do mitigate carbon emissions in the short-term while not deteriorating ecosystem condition. These include collecting fine woody debris within limits of locally established thresholds. We highlight the pathways that do little to mitigate carbon emissions and that are detrimental to ecosystems as well. These include removal of coarse woody debris and low stumps or the conversion of semi-natural, primary and old-growth forests to plantation forests with the purpose to produce bioenergy. We conclude that in the currently polarised debate an approach which unambiguously eliminates negative options is more fruitful than trying to find agreement on best options. Consequently, we present several governance measures that could limit the uptake of clearly undesirable pathways within Europe and we show that some lose-lose pathways are still considered “sustainable” within the European Green Deal.",2022

This shift promotes a model of health care centered on patient empowerment and self-management. In a recent interview with Dave deBronkart, known as e-Patient Dave, we revisited the possibilities of this new approach aimed at empowering, engaging, and equipping e-patients in the context of the pandemic. This interview with deBronkart was originally used for a graduate course on digital health. However, after noticing many reoccurring themes throughout the discussion, we decided to further explore this matter.

There is a fine line between AI for good and AI for environmental degradation. Today, companies want to seize the benefits of AI, which distinctively involves reducing the company's carbon footprint. However, AI's carbon emissions differ as per the techniques involved in training it. As the saying goes, a coin always has two sides. Therefore, it cannot be denied that AI can be an effective tool for combating climate change, but its role in contributing to carbon emissions cannot be ignored. Multiple studies indicate that AI could be the game-changer in staving off anthropogenic climatic changes due to the deterioration of the environment and global warming. This double-edged relationship and interdependency of AI and carbon emissions are represented through a system of systems (SoS) approach. SoS states that a plan is created through multiple smaller systems, creating complexity in the design and vice versa. A complex system can be assumed as the world in general, where two individual independent systems AI and carbon emissions, when in interaction, create a complex complementary and contradictory relation, adding to the convolution of the system. This connection is demonstrated by conducting a network analysis and calculating the carbon emissions of six machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) models with different datasets but the same hyperparameters on a carbon emission calculator created through AI algorithms. The primary idea of this study is to encourage the AI society to create efficient AI models that may be used without compromising environmental issues.

It reviews how the use of AI as presented in the literature fits into national, international, human and ecological security perspectives [1]. A national climate security discourse could emphasise military uses of AI and its role in propaganda and misinformation. The international security discourse suggests that international organisations can take advantage of AI to conduct their mission. However, transnational companies can also benefit from AI, with potential negative outcomes on consumption and resource extraction. Public–private collaboration for military AI grants transnational companies and states tools to hinder environmental movements. A human security discourse emphasises the role of AI in reaching the sustainable development goals but should consider potential power imbalances to prevent inequalities. Finally, an ecological understanding of climate security emphasises the role of algorithms in shaping our vision of the environment, and how it potentially estranges us from other cosmologies and the environmental impact of AI.

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes a specific target for reducing businesses’ negative impacts on biodiversity and increasing their positive impacts to contribute toward the GBF mission and vision. “Nature Positive” is also emerging as a rallying call for mainstreaming the GBF. Merely tinkering with business as usual will not deliver these ambitions; transformative change is needed. However, how to operationalize transformative change toward Nature Positive and the GBF through meaningful actions and targets remains unclear, risking confusion, greenwashing, and failure to achieve global goals. This perspective draws on literature on social change to offer a practical framework for understanding and operationalizing transformative change for business toward a Nature Positive future. We define and describe the role of transformative change within a Nature Positive ambition and summarize the different types and scales of actions companies could take. This framework could help to plan mutually reinforcing actions and improve accountability for Nature Positive claims.",2024

Floods and droughts, which happen more frequently and intensely, significantly and negatively influence agricultural production. The objective of the meta-analysis is to identify impacts on various sectors, adaptation strategies, and the challenges of climate change in the Ethiopian context. Twenty-three peer-reviewed articles were identified from ScienceDirect and Web of Science, followed by PRISMA guidelines, and analyzed using Stata version 13. The results reveal that climate change negatively impacts agriculture (by changing crop suitability, phenology, and productivity), the environment, and society, resulting from shifting temperature and rainfall patterns. Temperature variations, patterns of precipitation, and severe weather conditions have profound implications for agricultural productivity, water resources, ecosystems, and human well-being, which are multifaceted and interlinked. In addition, the reviewed articles informed us that farmers have used different coping strategies in response to climate change, such as soil and water conservation, agroforestry practices, integrated soil fertility management, small-scale irrigation, the application of improved crop varieties, the use of improved livestock, mixed cropping, early and late planting, and the practice of income-generating activities. The random effects meta-regression result shows that effective implementation of the above-mentioned practices reduces the risk of climate change in different sectors. The assessment also points out many challenges to the realization of these approaches, such as the lack of financing, institutional support, insufficient stakeholder involvement, ecological and sociocultural factors, and limited access to weather information. The meta-analysis concludes that addressing challenges requires holistic and integrated approaches that encompass adaptation strategies, sustainable land and water management, and social resilience-building to help the resilience of Ethiopian communities and ecosystems in the face of a changing climate.",2024

In response, these countries are implementing Nature-based Solution to minimize these challenges and promote sustainable development. In this article we analyze the NbS programs implemented across the Himalayan region and assess the limitations of these NbS using the IUCN standard criteria of adherence to NbS for selected articles. We perform a systematic review of articles using the PRISMA methodology, through the Scopus, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases and followed by screening through the Rayyan web interface. Articles were screened out based on the location and lack of biodiversity and human well-being outcomes of NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions in the Himalayas primarily use a sustainable management approach (35.29%), followed by restoration (23.53%), conservation (11.76%), holistic management (11.76%), eco-DRR (11.76%) and green infrastructure (5.88%) to address societal and climatic challenges. Institutional execution of NbS was 29.41% more common compared to the implementation of NbS by community or farmer groups. Pineapple based agroforestry (83.04%), forest restoration (78.57%), spring water storage (83.04%), spring restoration (86.61%), groundwater recharge (82.14%), bio-fertilizer and pesticides (77.68%), watershed restoration (78.57%), community-based watershed management (77.68%), community-based DRR (81.25%), community-based forest management (81.25%), sustainable harvest of medicinal plants (77.68%) and wetland restoration (82.14%), adhere to the IUCN criteria.

Innovations and efficiencies in digital technology have lately been depicted as paramount in the green transition to enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, both in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and the wider economy. This, however, fails to adequately account for rebound effects that can offset emission savings and, in the worst case, increase emissions. In this perspective, we draw on a transdisciplinary workshop with 19 experts from carbon accounting, digital sustainability research, ethics, sociology, public policy, and sustainable business to expose the challenges of addressing rebound effects in digital innovation processes and associated policy. We utilize a responsible innovation approach to uncover potential ways forward for incorporating rebound effects in these domains, concluding that addressing ICT-related rebound effects ultimately requires a shift from an ICT efficiency-centered perspective to a “systems thinking” model, which aims to understand efficiency as one solution among others that requires constraints on emissions for ICT environmental savings to be realized.",2023

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was the first report from the international climate body that gave worldwide attention to urban climate change. Yet, a global situation of the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published after AR5 is not well represented in the literature. This literature void presents a difficulty in holistically understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing urban CAPs, hence painting a clearer picture for future urban climate planning. Here, we performed detailed qualitative content analyses on CAPs from 278 cities worldwide. This study sought to achieve two specific objectives; (1) to critically analyse the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published from 2015 to 2022, and (2) to examine the extent to which sampled urban CAPs align with selected climate action best practices. There have been variations in the adoption or publication of urban CAPs from 2015 to 2022 across city types and world regions. Our analysis showed a rise in the number of CAPs adopted or published during the global COVID-19 lockdown period as compared to the post and pre-COVID-19 lockdown period. We also observed a transition from developing mainly mitigation-focused CAPs pre-COP21 to both mitigation and adaptation CAPs. About 96% of the sampled urban CAPs are focusing on the transport sector to achieve climate objectives. More than half (55%) of cities with climate change mitigation-related urban CAPs (147 urban CAPs of 267 urban CAPs) do not have deep decarbonization pledges, with less than a quarter of the pledges likely to be achieved by 2030. We found that about 81% of 120 cities with deep decarbonization pledges are more likely to report baseline emission inventory in their urban CAPs. A lack of inclusiveness, transparency and verification, evidence-based climate planning, comprehensiveness, and integration were the most common areas of non-alignment with best practices. The explicit consideration of synergies, trade-offs, or conflicts is significantly low. The evidence is a catalyst for understanding the dynamics in existing urban CAPs to shape future urban climate action planning.",2023

This understanding is crucial for energy transitions dependent on households using technology to support the energy system. A sample of energy research studies conducted in OECD countries and sourced using a systematised literature search identifies a broad range of influences on household adoption and rejection of energy technologies. Thematic analysis organises these influences into a simple and accessible framework comprising five psychosocial categories: cognitive; social; affective; behavioural; and contextual. This contrasts starkly with the one-dimensional consumer archetypes found to dominate energy sector thinking on household energy transitions, which lack any behavioural realism. Applying this framework identifies affective influences – uncertainty, control, trust – as a key difference between findings for rejection rather than adoption, and innovative rather than established technologies. Key differences are also observed in studies comparing early adopters and mainstream consumers, whose participation in the future energy system is crucial. A novel meta-regression application demonstrates the potential for this new framework to improve the behavioural realism of future energy transitions work by energy researchers, practitioners and policymakers. The results of this review have three main implications. 1. Using the framework to broaden the range of influences on household decisions will improve energy sector's ability to engage households in energy transitions. 2. Understanding mainstream consumer rejection of innovative technologies is key to accelerating household participation in energy systems. 3. A concerted effort is needed to engage households excluded from energy transition benefits by market-based approaches.",2022

The research critically examines the design configurations, and optimal processing technologies such as biological, thermal, biochemical, hydrothermal, and electro-biochemical methods. Majority of the commercial plants are biochemical plants using anaerobic digestion, evidencing greater potential for co-digestion. Unlike solid waste or wastewater management, the scope for biological and thermal processing techniques is limited with most of the plants still in lab scale. The study underscores the crucial need to transition to circular economy and resource efficiency for sustainability. The study demonstrates how LOW management aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing water pollution, health, and climate action. Proposing a strategic framework for managing LOW encompassing technology, policies, markets, and the economy, with stakeholders' involvement considering social, economic, regulatory, and governance factors, the research discusses potential limitations in LOW disposal and advocates viable solutions for strategic liquid organic waste management. Integrated LOW management, policy coherence, comprehensive environmental laws, waste management regulation revisions, solution-oriented innovation, and nexus thinking will be required to move forward. In a rapidly changing environment, this information will assist policymakers and stakeholders in identifying research gaps and establishing effective liquid organic waste management strategies to promote sustainable development.",2024

There is currently a pressing need to develop best practices to minimise the potential environmental impacts of this new industry. Project-specific environmental management processes, such as environmental impact assessment (EIA), and the associated environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP), must be effective to sufficiently mitigate environmental impacts of deep-sea mining (DSM) projects. This paper identifies the key drivers, barriers, and enablers to polymetallic nodule mining from a review of recent literature and develops an environmental management framework prior to any exploitation licenses being approved. We explore how the drivers to polymetallic nodule mining are framed in a global context, including claims that it will facilitate clean energy transitions, increase mineral supply diversity, and improve life cycle sustainability. We highlight the key barriers to effective environmental management, including epistemic uncertainty about deep-sea ecosystems, assessment of harmful effects from mining activities, and stakeholder support for a social license. We identify three enablers, including the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, and adaptive management, all of which are highly interdependent and must be operationalised to address the identified barriers. The results of this analysis indicate a complex social-ecological narrative infused throughout recent literature, emphasising the need for systems-level thinking and broader stakeholder participation.

It is important to understand how different factors are interlinked to influence the business owners’/managers’ decisions for sustainability. Therefore, the gap between policies and their implementation in the workplace causes the failure of the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. To provide a clear picture, the present study intends to investigate the factors that might foster/hinder the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. The study provides a systematic literature review on sustainable business policies from 2015 to 2023.

This has led organizations around the globe to seek new approaches to protect their enterprise network. One such approach is the adoption of the Zero Trust security approach due to its many advantages over the traditional/perimeter security approach. Although zero trust presents a stronger defense approach over the perimeter security model, organizations are hesitant to fully embrace it. This is partly due to the lack of a unified zero-trust implementation framework that can be used to guide its adoption. As such, we conducted a multivocal review that included literature from both academic and non-academic sources to consolidate knowledge on the state-of-the-art of zero-trust implementation and identify gaps in literature. Our result shows that existing papers tend to have a narrow viewpoint on the approach of implementing zero trust, rather than an encompassing viewpoint that can provide a more holistic view on the topic.

Such schemes vary in their design, disclosure formats, mechanisms to influence behaviour and performance. Theoretical and practical questions remain about whether and how regulators can use voluntary and/or beyond compliance disclosures. The article develops a classification of information-based schemes based on whether the scheme is mandatory or voluntary, and whether the disclosures reveal compliance or beyond compliance performance behaviours. The classification is used to show how the different schemes (traditional, assurance, performance and proactive) work in practice with their associated risks, benefits and mechanisms.

To achieve Universal Health Coverage and the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda for 2030, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended the use of social enterprise, digital technology, and citizen engagement in the delivery of Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS) as part of its strategic vision for 21st century primary care.
Methods
We conducted a hermeneutic review of frameworks, models and theories on social enterprise, digital health, citizen engagement and IPCHS. This involved multiple iterative cycles of (i) searching and acquisition, followed by (ii) critical analysis and interpretation of literature to assemble arguments and evidence for conceptual relationships until information saturation was reached. This process identified a set of constructs which we synthesised into a testable framework.
Results
Several interdisciplinary frameworks, models and theories explain how social enterprises could use digital technology, and citizen engagement to enable the technical and social integration required to facilitate people-centred primary care. Innovative approaches can be used to maintain financial sustainability while delivering IPCHS at lower cost to vulnerable and marginalised populations in both developed and developing countries.

Small-scale hydropower systems may be a viable answer to these problems. Central Asian nations' hydropower resources are allocated unevenly. Regardless, it remains the most exploitable renewable energy source in the area, with both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan possessing some of the world's highest hydropower potential. Nonetheless, for fossil-fuel-rich nations like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, hydropower will play a significant role in the future energy balance. Furthermore, because rivers often run across many boundaries, water security plays an important role in cross-border relations between Central Asian countries. To achieve effective exploitation of small hydropower potential, technological and financial expenditures are needed to improve the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of diverse hydroelectric equipment by increasing lifetime, improving efficiency, and increasing yearly power output. Several of these issues can be resolved by installing small and micro hydropower plants in the many minor rivers and irrigation canals. A pumped hydro energy storage system should also be tested and certified for better usability.

Moreover, the mining, processing and refining of these elements involves substantial environmental and health risks, including, but not limited to, ecosystem degradation, chemical pollution, and hazards related to chemical and particulate exposure. Countries such as Australia, therefore, have developed national critical minerals strategies, which include investment in research to develop improved recovery methods and processing technologies. Australia has escalated continuous flow chemistry and critical minerals as critical priorities of national interest. In lieu of this, this review paper assesses the role of solvent extraction and other processing innovations using microchannel systems for the recovery of critical minerals. Microfluidic devices have captured worldwide attention for miniaturising reactor dimensions and, hence, provide huge potential for advancing the application of chemical processes that require precise control, enhanced mixing and rapid reactions. For mineral processing, continuous-flow operation can lead to advantages for extraction efficiency, processing time (productivity), and selectivity. Thus, this review summarises the up-to-date extraction performance of microfluidic devices along classes of critical minerals, as defined by their grouping in the periodic table. Attention is given to the fluidic concept used, e.g. the flow patterns, and how the microfluidic system is configured. From there, the achieved performance is reviewed, both for model and real world extractant solutions, the latter includes multiple minerals and issues of selectivity. Finally, a proposed recommendation is that microfluidics used should aim to impact the whole processing and supply chain, and to support and contribute to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) profiling, a crucial demand faced by the mining industry. The enabling technologies not only have the potential to change the environmental profile, but will also require a highly skilled and trained workforce, and hence can create new employment opportunities.",2022

However, there are multiple drawbacks associated with ports operating in traditional ways, such as higher cost, lower efficiency and generating more environmental pollution. Digital technologies have been researched and implemented gradually in green ports, especially in data collection and real-time monitoring, and these advances help to promote higher work efficiency and reduce detrimental environmental impacts. It was found that green ports (e.g. ports of Raffina, Los Angeles, and Long Beach) generally perform better in energy conservation and pollutant emission reduction. However, considering the variability in the level of digitalization, there are challenges in achieving effective communications between individual ports. Therefore, to optimize and update green port practices, a systematic review is necessary to comprehensively analyze the beneficial contributions of green ports. This review adopted bibliometric analysis to examine the shipping framework focusing on green ports digitalization and innovation. After that, with regards to the bibliometric results, five aspects were analyzed, including environment, performance, policy, technology, and management. Besides, intelligent life-cycle management was systematically discussed to improve green ports and maritime logistics performance and sustainability in three aspects, namely waste discharge, shipping management system and green ports management.

The overexploitation of groundwater resources and deterioration of water quality caused by pollution as well as the deficiencies of the existing infrastructure require immediate attention. The main goal of this paper is to carry out a multi-voiced multicriteria analysis that integrates the preferences of local researchers and decision makers in a process aimed at prioritizing watersheds that require the implementation of groundwater management instruments. Using the Criterium Decision Plus system, criteria and subcriteria were integrated into a spatial multi-voiced decision model for the prioritization of watersheds for groundwater resources management. The criteria chosen were Groundwater quality, Groundwater quantity, Land use with potential pollutant load, Equity and Intrinsic aquifer vulnerability. Criteria and subcriteria preferences analysis were derived from workshops with local researchers and decision makers. The spatial multi-voiced decision model identified five of the fourteen watersheds as high to very high priority and requiring groundwater resources management. Based on the local researchers' and decision makers' preferences and hierarchy scheme of the multi-voiced decision model the main criteria and subcriteria that contributed to the final model results were identified. Regarding the criteria, Groundwater quality, Equity and Groundwater quantity contributed extensively to the model.

Despite the advanced technologies used in UASs, the integration of UASs into the air traffic management regulatory framework is lacking, which affects air transport. International and regional air transport regulators, having identified the major technological challenges, are gradually developing fundamental principles for the consolidation of manned and unmanned air traffic. In this review, the development of a common framework and fundamental principles set by major international regulatory authorities (International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems) were examined.

National net-zero commitments are highly contingent on fossil fuel phaseout. India showed active leadership in the Glasgow Summit, 2021 by setting its Renewable Energy targets to 500 GW by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070. However, these entail major energy justice concerns as 80 % of India's electricity consumption is driven through fossil fuel sources. The phase-out of thermal power would hence pose risks to revenues, infrastructure, and employment. With costs and benefits of transition being unequally distributed, the social and economic burden is most likely to be shifted to rural populations, women, children, elderly, and vulnerable communities with weak agency to negotiate transition patterns. Thus, the question of ‘who benefits and how’ is central to India's energy transition story. Majority of the literature on energy justice emerges from the West and addresses questions of opportunities, challenges, economic implications, and policy, at the cost of exploring how justice concerns are embedded in transition dynamics. This study adopts a systematic approach to analyse energy transitions literature in the Indian context to identify how justice discourse interjects within this scholarship in terms of problematization and conceptualisation. In addition to exploring focus areas, methodological, geographical, and temporal trends, the study synthesises the literature to draw out major themes of enquiry. These themes are then analysed using the triumvirate lens of energy justice (distributive, recognition and procedural).",2023

Summarizing and discussing this research, this study highlights and substantiates the potential of big data strategies to help mitigate the risks and impact of socio-ecological vulnerability. Based on a qualitative desk review and analyses of secondary data, resilience is framed as a function of the adaptive, absorptive and transformative capacity of socio-political systems to withstand and cope with the adverse effects of disaster. In addition, this study emphasizes the major principles and components of effective big data use; e.g., open source tools, strong infrastructure, local skill development, context-specific data sources, ethical data sharing and experiential learning. This study reveals some important big data technologies that can be easily used in the different phases of disaster management and enhancing resilience such as remote sensing imagery, social media data, crowdsourced data, geographic information system (GIS), and mobile metadata. The findings hold major relevancy for policymakers, administrators, and related stakeholders responsible for taking action before, during and after disasters through training, early warning systems, emergency evacuation, relief distribution and other key infrastructural components.",2020

Decentralized urban planning is a policy tool and practice that is used to organize urban infrastructure for sustainable development. Yet, how it can be used to sustain the urban commons remains fragmented in the literature. This study reviews and synthesizes urban planning and urban commons literature using the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework and the non-cooperative game theory to identify how urban planning can protect and sustain the urban commons – green commons, land commons, and water commons – in Ghana. The study, based on the determination of different theoretical scenarios for the urban commons, identified that decentralized urban planning can help sustain the urban commons, but it is operationalized in an unfavorable political environment. For green commons, there are competing interests and poor coordination amongst planning institutions, and the absence of self-organizing bodies in managing the use of such resources. For land commons, increased land litigations are characterized by corruption and poor management of land cases in the formal land courts, and despite the existence of self-organizing institutions, these institutions have failed to act responsibly to protect land commons due to the increasing demands and values (profitability) of lands in urban areas. For water commons, urban planning has not been fully decentralized and there is also the absence of self-organizing bodies in urban water use and management. This is coupled with the waning of customary water protection provisions in urban centers. Based on the findings, the study generally proposes institutional strengthening as the bedrock for enhancing the sustainability of the urban commons through urban planning and should therefore be of policy focus moving forward.",2023

Incumbent-oriented transition intermediaries in a low-carbon era,"Sociotechnical transitions, incumbency, low-carbon innovation, intermediaries, intermediation, sustainability transitions","Transitions intermediaries—agents who connect diverse groups of actors involved in transitions processes and their skills, resources and expectations—are becoming more prominent in research on low-carbon transitions. Most work, however, has focused on their ability to push innovations or emerging technologies forward, emphasising their involvement in disrupting incumbent regimes or firms. However, in focusing on new entrants, often at the grassroots level, such literature runs the risk of overlooking the potentially positive role that incumbent transition intermediaries—those oriented to work with or centrally consider the interests of dominant government, market or civic stakeholders—can play in meeting sustainable energy and transport goals. In this paper, we focus specifically on five different incumbent transition intermediaries—Smart Energy GB in the United Kingdom, Energiesprong in the Netherlands, SULPU in Finland, CERTU in France, and the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association —and explain their efforts to meet socially desirable goals of accelerating innovation or decarbonizing energy or transport systems. We ask: Why were these intermediaries created, and what problems do they respond to? How do they function? What are their longer-term strategies and aspirations? In what ways do they reflect, reinforce, or otherwise shape incumbency? In answering these questions via a comparative case study approach, the paper aims to make contributions to the study of incumbency and intermediation in the context of transitions, to identifying different types of incumbent intermediaries (market, governmental, civic), and to informing debates over energy and climate policy and politics.",2020

The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES. The realization of this transformation requires the escape from locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid. This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of 'socio-political acceptance' concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production within STSs applying DES. Renewables become 'common goods' in such systems, instead of 'private' or 'public' goods. Systems providing 'common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage, intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES infrastructures.",2020

Previous studies have used the LCA method to evaluate the environmental and energy performance of single spent LIB recycling. However, lacking research can provide an overall view of the spent LIBs recycling. This study uses a systematic meta-analysis method to quantitatively analyze different independent research results. We draw the following conclusions. (1) The global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) of recycling 1 kg spent LIBs are 0.158–44.59 kg CO2-eq and 3.3–154.4 MJ, respectively. (2) There are significant differences in GWP and CED during the life cycle of LIBs recycling with different battery types, shapes, recycling processes, and electric sources. Compared with NCM batteries, the GWP and CED of recycled LFP batteries are higher. The combined hydro-pyrometallurgical process performs the best for GWP and CED, while the pyrometallurgy is the worst.

In response to the new situation requirements of the “carbon peak and carbon neutrality” background and the technical challenges of carbon emission reduction at the source of methane in coal mines, with “quality improvement and efficiency enhancement, carbon emission reduction” as the core, and “precise methane extraction, green and low-carbon” dual objectives as the guide. With “process technology and equipment intelligent innovation” as the main line, based on the technical aspects of the complete process of coal mine methane extraction, the technology system of precise methane extraction in the entire life cycle of coal mining has been actively explored and constructed. It has realized the coordinated coupling of precise methane extraction, and green and low-carbon. A carbon emission reduction technology system has been formed at the source of coal mine methane with reliable technology - low-consumption equipment - safety and intelligence. Subsequently, five key technical issues were investigated: precise prediction of methane content - methane emission volume - methane “sweet spot” resource areas, precise pre-extraction of methane in the mining coal seam by the “time-sharing + partitioning” method, precise extraction of pressure relief methane from mining by the “regional segmentation + directional” method, precise extraction of methane from the “sweet spot” resource areas in abandoned mine, and “dynamic + intelligent” precise control of coal seam methane extraction.

Although peer-to-peer trading has promising benefits, its application in the real-world is limited and often not encouraged. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive literature review of the business models of 50 peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading projects around the world. The aim of this study is to explore the strengths, limitations and challenges of peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading considering its prevailing business arrangements to identify the critical requirements for its uptake in the real-world market. The findings reveal that peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading has characteristics of both coordinated and decentralised markets. Peer-to-peer trading is very effective when combined with value-added services such as energy storage, demand-side management, energy optimisation and information services. The key strength of peer-to-peer trading is the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to provide a secure and transparent trading environment. The main limitations to the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the real world are the lack of regulations on trading between peers, the lack of public awareness, the complexity of the technology and the lack of government motivation.

The Sharing City shares common discursive ground with the Sharing Economy, which is now in vogue. However, the sharing city adopts a clear human centric focus which differentiates it from other city labels or the more economic, commercial focus of previous literature on the sharing economy. The concept of the sharing city focuses, to a great extent, on how people interact with each other in order to share resources, spaces, infrastructures experiences etc within the city. Sharing city projects emphasize citizen and community participation and promote values such as social justice, well-being and sustainability. But also, by engaging in sharing practices, actors transform the city. This study analyses for first time the academic landscape of the sharing city and its social practices using a systematic literature review methodology. It is based on a systematic search of the literature in the WOS and Scopus databases resulting in the review of 80 peer-reviewed papers. Our systematic literature review shows how previous literature in this field has evolved over time. Also, it focuses on the social practices linked to the sharing city and presents in what contexts sharing in the city is taking place, what actors have led the initiatives, what disciplines have studied the sharing city and what objectives the sharing city sets. Then, gaps and future research lines are discussed. Although the sharing city has been studied mainly by certain specific disciplines, it is a concept with a multidisciplinary nature that invites new approaches and focusses. Also, implications for practitioners are suggested.",2021

Based on the shortcomings detected in the circular economy literature, we followed a three steps procedure. Firstly, we conducted a narrative literature review that underlies the need of understanding the circular economy as a resilient, sustainable and circular economy, and we identified twelve principles to operationalize the circular economy under the environmental sustainability paradigm. Secondly, we created a database containing information on twenty-six strategies of circular economy. Thirdly, we analyzed the data to assess how the principles explored in phase 1 are being considered by the current circular economy strategies. Results revealed a high variability of approaches performed by the governments to reach the circular economy. Moreover, strategies grouped into the resilience domain are barely incorporated into circular economy strategies, and hence some circular economy strategies reveal shortcomings in their capacity to generate real changes. Further research is needed to perform a more holistic analysis based on complex adaptative system thinking, which would allow connecting more essential elements to enhance a socially fair development that preserves the environment.",2021

Following the 2018 European directive RED II, these projects have rapidly increased across the continent, showcasing their potential for creating sustainable local energy systems. While studies highlight economic, environmental, and social benefits, barriers such as regulatory challenges, finance access, and low public awareness remain. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review that explores the state-of-the-art of the academic research on energy communities. The study adopts a systematic approach to examine the body of literature on the topic to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon on the basis of rigorous and replicable research criteria. The reviewed material consists of 140 articles collected through the Scopus database, evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group the literature into analytical categories. The analysis of scientific papers published between 2018 and 2022 shows a growing attention towards Renewable Energy Communities, particularly those based on solar energy for electricity production, often combined with storage systems and heat pumps, whereas attention towards energy communities based on thermal energy production is still limited. Furthermore, most scholars focused on analysing specific territorial contexts; comparisons between different regions allows to highlight common features and elements characterizing each model. It emerged that the development of energy communities depends mainly on regulatory, financial, and managerial barriers that require an adequate institutional and legal framework capable of promoting their diffusion. Most studies address the topic from an economic perspective, often in association with incentivizing community models. However, a social perspective should be included by introducing the concept of energy sharing and methodologies for its distribution among all members of the community. The scientific community is called upon to continue investigating and supporting the development of community energy initiatives by providing evidence-based recommendations to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities. This can help to overcome existing barriers and facilitate the diffusion of energy communities models, contributing to the achievement of sustainable and inclusive energy transition goals.",2024

It enables the development of smart hardware as well as software platforms that operate on the basis of communication systems and the algorithms that process the data collected by the sensors to support decision-making. Although IoMT is involved in large-scale services provisioning in the medical paradigm; however, the resource-constrained nature of these devices makes them vulnerable to immense security and privacy issues. These vulnerabilities are not only disastrous for IoMT but threaten the whole healthcare ecosystem, which can in turn bring human lives in danger. During the past few years, threat vectors against IoMT have been evolved in terms of scalability, complexity, and diversity, which makes it challenging to detect and provide stringent defense solutions against these attacks. In this paper, we classify security and privacy challenges against different IoMT variants based on their actual usage in the healthcare domain. We provide a comprehensive attack taxonomy on the overall IoMT infrastructure comprising different device variants as well as elaborate taxonomies of security protocols to mitigate attacks against different devices, algorithms and describe their strengths and weaknesses. We also outline the security and privacy requirements for the development of novel security solutions for all the attack types against IoMT.

We conduct a systematic literature review of 84 peer-reviewed articles. Through a qualitative content analysis, we provide a framework that brings together interdisciplinary research and highlights the six main topics studied. Furthermore, we showcase two main perspectives on the topic: (i) a technical perspective that mainly focuses on making the necessary information available to all actors and (ii) a supply chain perspective that studies the impact of information sharing. We argue that for increased circularity: (i) interorganizational information sharing between business areas like manufacturing and recycling must be improved, (ii) access to information for all circular economy actors must be facilitated, and (iii) incentives for CE information sharing must be created.

Over the last three decades, the demand for various minerals has steadily increased, while the mineral processing industry has seen an unavoidable increase in the treatment of complex ores, continuous decline in plant feed grade and poor plant performance partly due to blending of ores with dissimilar properties. Despite these challenges, production plant data that are routinely generated are usually underutilised. In this contribution and aligned with the direction of the 4th industrial revolution, we highlight the value of legacy metallurgical plant data and the concept of a dry laboratory approach. This study is presented in two parts. In the current paper (Part I), a comprehensive review of the potential for the combination of modern analytical technology with data analytics to generate a new competence for process optimisation are provided. To demonstrate the value of data within the extractive metallurgy discipline, we employ data analytics and simulation to examine gold plant performance and the flotation process in two separate case studies in the second paper (Part II). This was done with the aim of showcasing relevant plant data insights, and extract parameters that should be targeted for plant design and performance optimisation. We identify several promising technologies that integrate well with existing mineral processing plants and testing laboratories to exploit the concept of a dry laboratory, in order to enhance pre-existing mineral processing chains. It also sets the passage in terms of the value of innovative analysis of existing and simulation data as part of the new world of data analytics. Using data- and technology-driven initiatives, we propose the establishment of dry laboratories and data banks to ultimately leverage integrated data, analytics and process simulation for effective plant design and improved performance.",2020

As only recently energy communities were formally defined in the European regulatory framework, the literature on energy community business models is still scattered and a clear systematization of community arrangements is missing. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of the prevailing and emergent energy communities business models, focusing on the value proposition offered by these initiatives. Community projects across Europe are analyzed and eight community business model archetypes are identified having the current European regulatory framework as background. The Business Model Canvas and the Lean Canvas frameworks are used to characterize and compare these archetypes. The main differences between business models are examined to highlight the most relevant strengths and barriers for energy community development. This analysis revealed the dominance of traditional self-consumption place-based communities, while business models involving differentiated services as demand flexibility, aggregation, energy efficiency and electric mobility are still scarce. However, the research around novel business models must be strengthened as they are expected to become crucial in upholding energy communities as key players in the energy transition and foster the regulatory framework evolution.",2021

As the world has placed hope on the vaccination progress to bring back the socio-economic “normal,” this article explores how the bioeconomy can enhance the resilience and sustainability of bio-based, food, and energy systems in the post-COVID-19 era. The proposed recovery approach integrates technological innovations, environment, ecosystem services, “biocities,” food, rural economies, and tourism. The importance of integrating culture, arts, and the fashion industry as part of the recovery is underlined towards building a better bioeconomy that, together with environmental safeguards, promotes socio-cultural and economic innovations. This integration could be achieved supporting communities and stakeholders to diversify their activities by combining sustainable production with decarbonization, stimulating private investments in this direction and monitoring the resulting impact of mitigation measures.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly emerging technology in healthcare that has the potential to revolutionise clinical nutrition. AI can assist in analysing complex data, interpreting medical images, and providing personalised nutrition interventions for patients. Clinical nutrition is a critical aspect of patient care, and AI can help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding patients' nutritional requirements, disease prevention, and management. AI algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify novel associations between diet and disease outcomes, enabling clinicians to make evidence-based nutritional recommendations. AI-powered devices and applications can also assist in tracking dietary intake, providing feedback, and motivating patients towards healthier food choices. However, the adoption of AI in clinical nutrition raises several ethical and regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and bias. Further research is needed to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of AI-powered nutrition interventions. In conclusion, AI has the potential to transform clinical nutrition, but its integration into clinical practice should be carefully monitored to ensure patient safety and benefit. This article discusses the current and future applications of AI in clinical nutrition and highlights its potential benefits.",2023

In this review article, we use the lens of constructivism from the international relations discipline to suggest that China's ecological civilization concept, the Global Energy Interconnection project, and the historical tributary system had rationalized these investments. China's cultural values, norms, and ideas, both historical and socially constructed by these ideational factors, shape its overseas ventures, including overseas grid investments. By doing so, we complement extant discourses on China's expansionism that are often limited to the rationales of liberal trade and world domination.

Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energy–water–land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied.

We systematically searched for synthesis literature (i.e. reviews) related to FSNH, published after January 1, 2018. We screened and extracted characteristics of these reviews and mapped them in an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM), supplemented by expert consultation. 844 synthesis reports met inclusion criteria (from 2,739 records) and were included in the EGM. The largest clusters of reports were those describing climate impacts on crop and animal source food (ASF) production, and emissions from such (86%). Comparatively few reports assessed climate change impacts on nutrition-related health, or food manufacture, processing, storage, and transportation. Reports focused on strategies of climate adaptation (40%), mitigation (29%), both (19%) or none (12%). Only one quarter of reports critically evaluated equity (25%), and fewer reports suggested that changes to equity and equitable practices would alter climate-FSNH dynamics (6%). The expert consultation mirrored the results of the EGM, and contextualised findings further. This novel map describes a wide research landscape linking climate change to FSNH. We identified four key research gaps, including 1) Research on whole food systems or post-harvest elements 2) Research evaluating relationships between climate change and nutrition-related health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations; 3) Promising methods (and additional data required) that can a) identify inflection points or levers for intervention, b) incorporate complex dynamics and characterize trade-offs, c) be understood and applied in context-specific, localised ways for decision-making; and 4) Research undertaken through interdisciplinary collaborations that enables producing and translating evidence to action, especially those that inherently consider co-production and fairness.",2024

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and global impact on health care, and has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technology. One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger. Blockchain technology has numerous potential COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications in health care. However, much of the current research remains at the technical stage, with few providing actual clinical applications, highlighting the need to translate foundational blockchain technology into clinical use.",2021

In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential drivers—such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.",2024

URI was introduced as a promising approach for mitigating the impact of climate hazards and environmental problems. Despite its increasing importance, the existing literature on URI has inadequately provided a comprehensive understanding of the patterns governing its evolution. To address this gap, this study analyzed 958 documents on URI published between 2000 and 2022, using CiteSpace software to examine the theoretical and practical applications of URI from multiple dimensions. Our findings reveal that the field has undergone a transformation since 2016, characterized by an increasing number of publications and a shift towards a multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approach. Researchers have expanded their focus from examining single climate disasters to evaluating the full life cycle impacts of urban ecology, social economics, and community health. The nature-based solutions cluster was the largest corpus of publications and aligns with the themes of global climate change and ecosystem services. Theoretical models such as social-economic adaptability and ecosystem restoration were the primary basis for research in this field. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence has advanced the theoretical framework and methodological approaches of URI. The utilization of complex algorithms and network analyses in the development of technical models has enabled the acquisition of sophisticated insights into the underlying mechanisms of urban resilience in diverse contexts and scenarios. The study underscored the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to urban infrastructure planning and management that considered social, economic, and environmental dimensions. It also contributed to a better understanding of the evolving field of URI and provides practical insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers interested in building more resilient and sustainable cities.",2024

Because buildings and cities play a substantial role in these societal challenges, we need reliable approaches that can be used to assess their resilience and sustainability. Given that building and urban systems are usually tightly coupled, we critically review nine building-scale assessment frameworks and seven urban-scale assessment frameworks, ranking them from high to low in terms of the causality among component systems. We identify four major knowledge gaps that, to varying degrees, span the entire range of assessment frameworks: (1) causality among component systems and their subsystems is limited; (2) sustainability and resilience are too narrowly defined; (3) social systems are inadequately addressed; and (4) building- and urban-scale assessments are poorly connected. To address these limitations, we briefly introduce several closely-related fields of research including integrated assessment and modeling, social-ecological systems research, land systems science, socio-environmental systems modeling, modeling of human behavior, multi-scale modeling, and multi-fidelity modeling. Building on these rapidly emerging research domains, we conclude by proposing a more holistic, multi-scale, system-of-systems approach that connects across building and urban scales using several common systems.",2022

The current food production system and agricultural policies rely heavily on international supply chains, creating instead a dependence on external sources for food security, while internal sources have been declining for years due to territorial food specialization and monocrops. Since the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, global supply chains have experienced unprecedented disruptions due to a combination of factors. The lack of strategic planning to ensure food security continuity in the midst of the geopolitical landscape, supply chain disruption, and soil security overlooked, significantly increase the risk of food and agricultural input shortages, price volatility, and labor disruptions affecting both industrialized and developing countries. In addition, misunderstanding, undervaluation, and underestimation of securing soil among stakeholders, policymakers and legislation are significant factors that exacerbate the problem. As a result, threats to the supply chain compromise the pillars of food security in ways that affect countries unequally, potentially leading to social instability and threatening national and international security. By treating soil as the cornerstone of national security, countries can develop coherent soil policies and strategies. This approach could lead to the development of coordinated decisions and the implementation of a global agenda for sustainable agricultural practices, improve food security, and ensure long-term stability and resilience. This article aims to examine how securing soil emerges as a pivotal strategy for ensuring food security and fostering national and international security during times of disruption.",2024

However, studies addressing brownfield risks from the perspective of climate change have received limited attention. Nonetheless, the detrimental consequences of brownfield risks are intrinsically linked to strategies for mitigating and adapting to sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical importance of their far-reaching implications. This relevance extends to concerns about environmental quality, safety, health risks, and the efficacy of chosen regeneration strategies, including potential secondary pollution risks. This comprehensive review systematically surveys pertinent articles published between 1998 and 2023. A selective analysis was conducted on 133 articles chosen for their thematic relevance. The findings reveal that: (1) Under the backdrop of the climate change process, brownfield restoration is necessitated to provide scientific and precise guidance.

Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management practices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments’ commitment towards solid waste management should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.",2022

These changes lead to inputs of marine salts into freshwater-dependent coastal systems, creating saltwater intrusion. The penetration of salinity into the coastal interior is exacerbated by groundwater extraction and the high density of agricultural canals and ditches throughout much of the rural U.S. landscape. Together saltwater intrusion and sea level rise (SWISLR) create substantial changes to the social-ecological systems situated along the coastal plain. Many scholars and practitioners are engaged in studying and managing SWISLR impacts on social, economic, and ecological systems. However, most efforts are localized and disconnected, despite a widespread desire to understand this common threat. In addition to variable rates of sea level rise across the U.S. outer coastal plain, differences in geomorphic setting, water resources infrastructure and management, and climate extremes are resulting in different patterns of saltwater intrusion. Understanding both the absolute magnitude of this rapid environmental change, and the causes and consequences for its spatial and temporal variation presents an opportunity to build new mechanistic models to link directional climate change to temporally and spatially dynamic socio-environmental impacts.

These MPAs are static in nature and are rarely considering climate change; therefore, their potential adaptation effectiveness as local adaptation measures for conservation in response to climate change are not clear. Here we discuss the challenges to Marine Protected Areas as conservation tools and for adaptation to climate change threats. We use two case studies from the UK to ask how climate change resilience could be included in MPA management to future-proof these conservation measures. We conclude that the resilience of MPAs to climate change would be better supported when adaptive management measures and an ecosystem-based approaches are adopted. We emphasise the need to increase the recognition in the primary legislation of MPAs and the monitoring of sites to better understand climate change as it becomes more pronounced, and impacts emerge.",2022

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.",2020

Rare diseases affect over 300 million people worldwide and are gaining recognition as a global health priority. Their inclusion in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Resolution on Addressing the Challenges of Persons Living with a Rare Disease, and the anticipated WHO Global Network for Rare Diseases and WHO Resolution on Rare Diseases, which is yet to be announced, emphasise their significance. People with rare diseases often face unmet health needs, including access to screening, diagnosis, therapy, and comprehensive health care. These challenges highlight the need for awareness and targeted interventions, including comprehensive education, especially in primary care. The majority of rare disease research, clinical services, and health systems are addressed with specialist care. WHO Member States have committed to focusing on primary health care in both universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Recognising this opportunity, the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) assembled a global, multistakeholder task force to identify key barriers and opportunities for empowering primary health-care providers in addressing rare disease challenges.",2024

Access to clean, modern, and affordable energy, also known as SDG 7, is one of the goals. Universal access to clean, modern, and affordable electricity is one of the metrics for measuring a good life as it fundamentally affects education, healthcare, food security, job creation, and other socioeconomic indices. To achieve this goal and targets, there has been increased traction in research, development, actionable plans, policies, and other activities by governments, the scientific community, environmentalists, development experts, and other stakeholders in achieving the goal. This review presents the various avenues by which AI and digitization can provide impetus to achieving SDG 7. The global trends in attaining clean electricity, clean cooking fuel, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and international public financial flows between 2005 and 2021 are reviewed while the contribution of AI and digitization towards meeting SDG 7 are highlighted. The study concludes that the deployment of AI and digitization into the energy sector will catalyze the attainment of SDG 7 by 2030, provided ethical issues, regulatory concerns, manpower shortage, and other shortcomings are effectively handled. The study recommends adequate infrastructural upgrades, modernization of data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities, improved awareness and education, professional development, collaborative innovation, and promotion of legal and ethical issues as ways of advancing universal access to energy by 2030. Going forward, more collaborations between academic and research institutions and energy producers will help produce experts and professionals to propel innovative deployment of digital technologies in the energy sector.",2024

Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about their use for supporting public health efforts. In epidemic surveillance and containment, efforts are needed to treat critical patients, track and manage the health status of residents, isolate suspected cases, and develop vaccines and antiviral drugs. The applications of emerging practices of artificial intelligence and big data have become powerful “weapons” to fight against the pandemic and provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control, such as early warning, analysis and judgment, interruption and intervention of epidemic, to achieve goals of early detection, early report, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment. These are the decisive factors to control the spread of the epidemic and reduce the mortality. This paper systematically summarized the application of big data and AI in epidemic, and describes practical cases and challenges with emphasis on epidemic prevention and control. The included studies showed that big data and AI have the potential strength to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet widely accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research would be on methods that promise value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for practice.",2023

A huge number of review research studies have been published that review previous IoT related research and more recent advances in a wide number of different IoT technologies and applications. However, as yet, there has not been any meta-review conducted to comprehensively analyze all current IoT review publications. The main objective of this survey is to present the research community with an overview and analysis of IoT review studies that have been published so far, and what challenges still remain that need to be addressed in this field. This paper also attempts to report the enabling factors that were identified, as well as the weaknesses and the risk factors in the current published survey papers. First, IoT review publications were classified into eight categories: IoT applications, types, security, data, communication networks, development, protocol standards, and technologies. Second, the bibliometric indicators were used to identify the leading trends in the IoT field. Third, a graphical/spatial mapping of the bibliographic material, journals and author co-citation networks, the bibliometric coupling of countries, and the co-occurrence of keyword network maps were developed from the IoT reviews. The results indicate that IoT applications, technologies, and security categories had the highest number of publications, whereas the IoT data and network categories had the lowest amount of publications, each of them had less than 5.5% of the total.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122813,,Trade-offs and conflicts between urban climate change mitigation and adaptation measures: A literature review,"Climate change, Mitigation, Adaptation, Conflict, Trade-off, Interaction","Many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and policies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These plans and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally, conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular, limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water, building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated frameworks are provided.",2020

A systematic literature review,"Sustainable development, Traditional village, Rural tourism, Systematic review, Spatial, Economic, Sociocultural","Rural tourism has been widely recognized as a means of promoting the revival of traditional villages and has been supported by numerous researchers. It has the potential to provide significant social and economic advantages, making it a popular strategy for rural development in both developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, a growing body of research has substantiated the significant disruptions that rural tourism has imposed on traditional villages. This study employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) qualitative method to systematically analyze 92 papers from WOS and SCOPUS that investigate the impact of rural tourism on traditional villages. The papers were categorized into five groups: spatial, economic, sociocultural, and holistic. This categorization allowed for the identification of the purpose, theme, sub-topics, research methods, and data sources used in these papers, which in turn provided an overview of the characteristics and overall trends in research in this field. It compensates for the deficiencies of lesser reviews that just emphasize rural tourism as the primary catalyst for the sustainable development of traditional villages. Based on a thorough investigation, this paper asserts that the development of tourism in traditional villages should be differentiated from typical rural tourism sites that prioritize the preferences of tourists. The primary objective should be to prioritize the preservation of community values, with a strong emphasis on community participation. This should be done while considering the interests of various stakeholders and promoting a diverse range of livelihoods that are rooted in traditional practices. By doing so, the essence of authenticity in traditional villages can be reinforced, leading to a greater sense of connection and loyalty among tourists. The preservation of traditional village genes fosters a symbiotic relationship with rural tourism, resulting in a mutually beneficial cycle.",2024

Almost all operational research (OR) is engaged with clients, but it is mainly in the areas of Soft and Community OR that wider stakeholder and citizen participation has been a significant focus. It is the involvement of citizens that is the subject of this paper. We surveyed OR literature and compiled a corpus of 62 studies, the earliest from 1970, to systematically characterize the involvement of citizens in OR processes. Our review produced three findings: First, some fields of OR have embraced citizen participation, but this is not yet a major concern outside the field of Community OR. Second, citizen participation in OR processes is often driven by a moral rationale. Third, progress in information and communication technology (ICT) enables broad participation, but traditional processes requiring physical presence can also be participatory. From these insights, we formulate research opportunities for OR. (1) OR may join Community OR's endeavor to engage with and empower citizens who have so far rarely been involved in OR processes. (2) OR may identify benefits and drawbacks of digital OR processes in empirical studies. (3) OR may determine whether involving large numbers of citizens is suitable for the societal scale. (4) OR may research building and maintaining trust. (5) OR may join efforts for data protection of participants. (6) OR may systematically report and reflect on participatory OR processes. (7) OR should continue researching the fair aggregation of individual inputs. Citizen participation in OR is topical and challenging. Pursuing these research opportunities will contribute to OR fulfilling its mandate of better decision-making in close cooperation with all affected stakeholders.",2024

Danish district heating is known as unique internationally in terms of heat planning strategies, technical solutions and combinations, energy efficiency and sustainability, ownership models and financing, and it has captured the attention of district heating communities and stakeholders worldwide from the early days. Historically, a ban on landfills incentivised waste incineration, and the strategic integration of combined heat and power plants and recycling of waste heat from industry all increased energy efficiency in the energy system. Ultimately, this contributed to the top World Energy Council ranking of the Danish energy system according to the energy trilemma criteria. A cooperative mind-set, welfare state values and the notions of energy efficiency-, availability-, independency- and sustainability were all pivotal for the evolution of the district heating networks throughout Denmark. Other unique features of the Danish district heating sector include large-scale collective heat planning, the mandatory connection, the non-profit principle, the same approximate price for customers irrespective of heat density, and the relatively high average price of district heating. Moreover, district heating knowledge hubs have led to world-wide exports of district heating technologies and know-how. Future challenges for the Danish district heating sector include increasing biomass import dependency, the changing role of combined heat and power plants in the energy system, transitions to non-combustion heat supplies, and competition from individual heat pumps in single-family houses. However, future ‘smart’ thermal grids will increasingly facilitate sector coupling processes as more renewable energy resources are integrated into the energy system in Denmark and internationally.",2022

However, throughout the last decade, digitalization has fundamentally transformed the business world and put into question traditional strategy wisdom. As information technologies are the driver of this digital transformation, we can expect an even more fundamental change in IT/IS strategy thinking. To verify this expectation, we undertook an in-depth, extensive review of the academic literature on this topic. Our review, which is time-framed to the years 2008–2018, distils five different directions in the development of IT/IS strategy research. It also identifies a shift in how IT/IS strategy is defined and investigated over this period. Moreover, we present an emerging debate on how digitalization challenges traditional IT/IS strategy wisdom. As this debate is still in its infancy, we take it further by entering into the larger discussion on digitalization, including digital innovation, digital ecosystems, and digital transformation. Building on this, we derive at deeper insights on how IT/IS strategy could, should, or should better not be understood in the digital age.",2020

While the final energy consumption and the related carbon footprint of information and communication technologies (ICT) are well studied, other environmental factors and some phases of the life cycle are still poorly understood. New connected equipment and services currently being deployed make such assessments even more complex. In addition, more research is needed on the indirect effects of ICT (i.e. substitution, optimization, and various rebound effects). Indeed, recent reports tend to ignore or minimize the negative effects of digitization.

In global supply chains that are increasingly becoming internetworked and data-centric, risk management assists risk managers in making smart decisions to achieve their desired outcomes. Because of its importance, there are many studies in the literature on supply chain risk management. However, most of these are from a managerial perspective, and very few provide a technical perspective by surveying the techniques that have been used for risk management and their effectiveness. In this paper, we focus on the activity of risk identification and assess the suitability of the techniques used for this process to be effective in the current networked supply chain environment. We do this by first surveying the domain-independent risk identification techniques proposed between 1980 and 2020 and study the type of technique they use, classifying them according to the proposed taxonomy and then evaluating them to determine whether they meet the requirements of identifying risks in the networked environment. We then survey the techniques used for supply chain risk identification between 1980 and 2020 and determine their suitability along with their limitations in meeting the requirements of identifying risks in the networked supply chain environment. Based on the identified gaps, we then present different solution considerations to inform supply chain risk managers of the improvements needed to be made in the process of risk identification to meet the requirements of networked global supply chains.",2021

Much attention has been paid in the academic literature to the transition of the underlying energy system with its macroeconomic market framework. However, fewer contributions focus on the microeconomic aspects of the broad set of involved actors. Even though specific case studies highlight single business models, a comprehensive analysis of emerging business models for the entire set of actors is missing. Following this research gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of 135 peer-reviewed journal articles to examine business models of actors operating in local energy markets. From 221 businesses in the reviewed literature, nine macro-actor categories are identified. For each type of market actor, a business model archetype is determined and characterised using the business model canvas. The key elements of each business model archetype are discussed, and areas are highlighted where further research is needed. Finally, this paper outlines the differences of business models for their presence in the three local energy market models. Focusing on the identified customers and partner relationships, this study highlights the key actors per market model and the character of the interactions between market participants.",2023

This paper considers three such literatures: Value Sensitive Design, Responsible Research and Innovation and the Energy Justice framework. We argue that whilst definitions of these concepts appear, on face value, to be united by a common normative goal – improving the social outcomes and mitigating sensitivities at the interface of technological energy systems and human livelihoods –, their existence in academic silos has obscured complementarities, which, once synthesized, might increase their overall academic and practical relevance. This paper fills the emergent gap of critically discussing the concepts and their strengths and challenges as well as how they could contribute to each other. It compares: (1) the things that they claim to tackle, (2) the solutions they claim to provide and (3) the points that clearly distinguish one approach from another (if any at all). Not only does this make this paper the first of its kind, but it also makes it an impactful one.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2021.101615,,Is blockchain ready for orthopaedics? A systematic review,"Blockchain, Distributed ledger, Internet of things, Image sharing, Implant tracking, Research collaboration","Introduction
The unique attributes of distributed ledger blockchain systems including robust security, immutability, transparency, and decentralisation, make them highly suitable solutions for many healthcare-related problems. This review examines the potential applications for blockchain technology in the field of orthopaedics, by taking a systematic approach to the evolving blockchain literature and mapping potential use cases against the current needs of orthopaedic practice.
Method
A literature search was performed using Pubmed, EMBASE, OVID and the Cochrane library with the primary aim of identifying detailed accounts of blockchain solutions and use cases in healthcare. These articles were then reviewed and mapped against current orthopaedic practice to illustrate applications specific to that specialty.
Results
One hundred and forty-one papers were identified which described case studies, simulations, or detailed proposals of blockchain solutions in healthcare. Most studies described blockchain solutions at the simulated or prototype testing phase, with only 10 case studies describing blockchains in “real-world” use. The most frequently cited use cases for blockchain technology involved the storage, security and sharing of electronic medical records. Other blockchain solutions focused on the “Internet of Things”, research, COVID 19, supply chains and radiology. There were no solutions focusing specifically on orthopaedics. Many of the described blockchain solutions had considerable scope for application in orthopaedic practice however, providing the potential for greater inter-institutional collaboration, cross border data exchange, enhanced patient participation, and more robust and transparent research practices.
Conclusion
Blockchain solutions for healthcare are increasing in number and scope and have multiple applications relevant to orthopaedic practice. The orthopaedic community needs to be aware of this innovative and growing field of computer science so that surgeons can leverage the power of blockchain safely for the future of orthopaedics.",2021

To set the stage for this Special Issue we present an analysis of key research topics, most influential papers and innovation journals, highlighting contributions across four interrelated themes: fostering climate action, shaping policy, promoting experimentation and learning, and examining effectiveness. While past studies and this special issue made significant contributions, we suggest that research on innovation have not sufficiently engaged with three important topics: i) blending behavioural change with technological innovation; ii) the socio-technical drivers of accelerated low-carbon transitions, and iii) the role of digital technologies as new venues of solutions to managerial challenges in addressing climate change.

Tackling climate change requires significant behavior change to reduce emissions, yet the scale required is far from being achieved. Behaviors are influenced by psychological characteristics, social and cultural norms, material and spatial environments, and political conventions. Much social scientific debate continues to be characterized by calls for either individual or system change, but a more cross-cutting perspective to understand various factors that can enable and accelerate pro-environmental choices is needed. This review provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of evidence on the potential and limitations of individual choice to mitigate climate change. We identify six domains of individual choice for climate action (food, energy, transport, shopping, influence, and citizenship). We find that individual, social, physical, and political factors combine to shape low-carbon choices but in ways specific to each domain, demanding different responses from policy-makers. Effective climate action requires a mix of interventions which address the multiple roles played by individuals: structural change by governments (“upstream” interventions), businesses and local authorities making sustainable options more available and attractive (“midstream”), and informational measures to shape individuals’ decision-making (“downstream”).",2023

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being promoted as an ocean-based climate solution. However, such claims remain controversial because of the diffuse and poorly synthesized literature on climate benefits of MPAs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 22,403 publications spanning 241 MPAs and analyzed these across 16 ecological and social pathways through which MPAs could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that marine conservation can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms as well as fishers’ catch and income. Most of these benefits are only achieved in fully or highly protected areas and increase with MPA age. Although MPAs alone cannot offset all climate change impacts, they are a useful tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation of social-ecological systems.",2022

However, despite widespread interest in PSS, consensus regarding their actual environmental impacts, particularly with regard to salient issues such as global warming, is lacking. Hence this paper explores existing research to investigate the state of the art regarding the climatic impacts of PSS, alongside the set of factors that influence climatic impacts. The paper comprises a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature, quantifying the extent to which different types of PSS have the capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across multiple product categories. Our study shows that significant reductions in climatic emissions are possible, but PSS are in many cases associated with more modest reductions and, in some cases, increased emissions. Further, we observe no clear differences in climatic impacts according to the type of PSS model that is deployed. Rather, differences in climatic impact are influenced by factors such as production and design alongside use-phase impacts and contextual factors such as transportation and the energy mix. The study argues that further research is needed to establish a more robust baseline upon which to draw conclusions regarding the sources of climatic impacts, and outlines fruitful ways for companies to tackle the complexities of climatic emissions that are beyond their control.",2024

The perceptions of food waste and how it is used have changed over time. Prior to and during WWII, household food scraps and leftovers were reused and even upgraded into delicacies which are still valued even today. Currently about one third of food produced for human consumption is wasted and this accounts for a carbon and water footprint of 4.4 giga tons of CO2 equivalents and 250 km3 of blue water, respectively. In addition, food waste is responsible for significant wastage of land used for agriculture and 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Consumer food waste is a major source of the current food waste crisis. As consumer behavior is a key driver of food waste, strategies for reduction and avoidance of waste should appeal to consumers' individual values. Ways to prevent food waste, reuse and upscale recycling and recovery are reviewed. The potential of using waste for future food preparation, food waste avoidance tools and technologies are presented. Urgent action is needed for implementation of waste reduction interventions and more efficient food redistribution systems to improve food security and sustainability.",2024

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review of EIRM research in order to identify key areas of research progress and hotspots. This study used the bibliometric tool to analyze 6608 articles in the field of EIRM that were published from 2003 to 2022, which included research trend analysis, research power analysis, and research content analysis. The results revealed an upward trend in EIRM research over the past 20 years, with an average annual number of articles published of 330 and an average growth rate of 20.64 %. The countries with the highest number of publications in EIRM research are the USA (n = 1523), CHINA (n = 1233), and UNITED KINGDOM (n = 329). Moreover, the content analysis of these studies showed an evolution in the topics of EIRM research, moving from early medically controlled experimental studies to more specific disaster management and resilience studies. In conclusion, EIRM is a cross-disciplinary research field. Its important future research direction is to study how to process large-scale emergency information quickly and efficiently. Thus, it is essential to focus on overcoming the limitations of theoretical frameworks, technological development and application scenarios in order to realize a more efficient EIRM.",2023

Advances in computing power and analytical methods have allowed companies to reveal insights from the “big” data that previously would have gone undetected. Despite the promise, occupational safety has lagged behind other industries, such as supply chain management and healthcare, in terms of exploiting the potential of analytics and much of the data collected by organizations goes unanalyzed. The purpose of the present paper is to argue for the broader application of establishment-level safety analytics. This is accomplished by defining the terms, describing previous research, outlining the necessary components required, and describing knowledge gaps and future directions. The knowledge gaps and future directions for research in establishment-level analytics are categorized into readiness for analytics, analytics methods, technology integration, data culture, and impact of analytics.",2023

Blockchain, the open, decentralized, distributed public ledger technology powering cryptocurrency, records transactions securely without the need for third-party verification. In the health care setting, decentralized blockchain networks offer a secure interoperable gateway for clinical research and practice data. Here, we discuss recent advances and potential future directions for the application of blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular medicine. We first review the basic underlying concepts of this technology and contextualise it within the spectrum of current, well known applications. We then consider specific applications for cardiovascular medicine and research in areas such as high-throughput gene sequencing, wearable technologies, and clinical trials. We then evaluate current challenges to effective implementation and future directions. We also summarise the health care applications that can be realised by combining decentralized blockchain computing platforms (for data security) and AI computing (for data analytics). By leveraging high-performance computing and AI capable of securely managing large and rapidly expanding medical databases, blockchain incorporation can provide clinically meaningful predictions, help advance research methodology (eg, via robust AI-blockchain decentralized clinical trials), and provide virtual tools in clinical practice (eg, telehealth, sensory-based technologies, wearable medical devices). Integrating AI and blockchain approaches synergistically amplifies the strengths of both technologies to create novel solutions to serve the objective of providing precision cardiovascular medicine.
Résumé
Les bases de données cliniques, en particulier celles composées de mégadonnées, font face à des défis croissants en matière de sécurité. La chaîne de blocs, une technologie de grand livre public ouverte, décentralisée et distribuée, qui alimente la cryptomonnaie, permet d’enregistrer les transactions de manière sécuritaire sans nécessiter une vérification par un tiers. Dans le milieu de soins de santé, les réseaux décentralisés de la chaîne de blocs constituent une passerelle interopérable sécurisée pour les données de recherche clinique et celles recueillies dans le cadre de la pratique. Dans cet article, nous discutons des percées récentes et des possibles orientations futures pour l’application de la chaîne de blocs et son intégration dans l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en médecine cardiovasculaire. Nous examinerons en premier lieu les concepts fondamentaux sous-jacents de cette technologie avant de les contextualiser dans le spectre des applications actuelles bien connues. Nous évaluerons ensuite les applications propres à la médecine cardiovasculaire et à la recherche dans des domaines comme le séquençage de gènes à haut débit, les technologies portables et les essais cliniques. Nous ferons ensuite le point sur les obstacles à leur mise en œuvre efficace et les orientations futures. Nous résumerons également les applications pouvant être mises en œuvre dans les soins de santé en combinant les plateformes décentralisées fondées sur la technologie de la chaîne de blocs (pour la sécurité des données) et l’IA (pour l’analyse de données). En s’appuyant sur le calcul haute performance et l’IA capable de gérer en toute sécurité de grandes bases de données médicales en expansion rapide, l’intégration de la chaîne de blocs peut fournir des données prévisionnelles cliniquement significatives, contribuer à l’avancement de la méthodologie de recherche (p. ex. par l’entremise de solides essais cliniques décentralisés fondés sur l’association IA-chaîne de blocs) et fournir des outils virtuels pour la pratique clinique (p. ex. télésanté, technologies sensorielles, dispositifs médicaux portables). L’intégration des approches IA et de la technologie de la chaîne de blocs amplifie de manière synergique les points forts de ces deux technologies pour créer de nouvelles solutions avec l’objectif d’offrir une médecine cardiovasculaire de précision.",2022

Citizens' interactions with each other reached such a point that they could contribute to the quality and quantity of e-government services. Examples of this citizen-to-citizen (C2C) interactions adding value to current e-government services or triggering new and innovative ones are increasingly observed worldwide. Although C2C interactions is not a new phenomenon, it is a relatively overlooked topic in e-government studies. Current e-government literature is insufficient in exploring and explaining the evolving nature, increasing occurrence, and various outcomes of these interactions. This article aims to fill the gap in the e-government literature by analyzing C2C interactions in detail and discusses how to regulate the C2C interaction processes and their useful and harmful outcomes. When C2C interactions get integrated into government activities and form e-government value chains (as in C2C2G or G4C2C), they contribute to the electronic provision of government information or services. C2C interactions also create beneficial (advantages of C2C) and harmful (disadvantages of C2C) outcomes. The main advantages of C2C interactions are their support for governments in making decisions, solving problems, and improving public services. Their main disadvantages are distributing misinterpreted or manipulative information, causing uncertainty, and even digital vigilantism. The article ends with suggestions for future research, such as different scenarios of government regulation for C2C interactions.",2022

For this purpose, federated learning (FL) was proposed as a technique that can learn a global machine model at a central master node by the aggregation of models trained locally using private data. However, organizations may be reluctant to train models locally and to share these local ML models due to the required computational resources for model training at their end and due to privacy risks that may result from adversaries inverting these models to infer information about the private training data. Incentive mechanisms have been proposed to motivate end users to participate in collaborative training of ML models (using their local data) in return for certain rewards. However, the design of an optimal incentive mechanism for FL is challenging due to its distributed nature and the fact that the central server has no access to clients’ hyperparameters information and the amount/quality data used for training, which makes the task of determining the reward based on the contribution of individual clients in FL environment difficult. Even though several incentive mechanisms have been proposed for FL, a thorough up-to-date systematic review is missing and this paper fills this gap. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review that comprehensively enlists the design principles required for implementing these incentive mechanisms and then categorizes various incentive mechanisms according to their design principles. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive overview of security challenges associated with incentive-driven FL. Finally, we highlight the limitations and pitfalls of these incentive schemes and elaborate upon open-research issues that require further research attention.",2023

The advent of mobile applications for health and medicine will revolutionize travel medicine. Despite their many benefits, such as access to real-time data, mobile apps for travel medicine are accompanied by many ethical issues, including questions about security and privacy.
Methods
A systematic literature review as conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Database screening yielded 1795 results and seven papers satisfied the criteria for inclusion. Through a mix of inductive and deductive data extraction, this systematic review examined both the benefits and challenges, as well as ethical considerations, of mobile apps for travel medicine.
Results
Ethical considerations were discussed with varying depth across the included articles, with privacy and data protection mentioned most frequently, highlighting concerns over sensitive information and a lack of guidelines in the digital sphere. Additionally, technical concerns about data quality and bias were predominant issues for researchers and developers alike. Some ethical issues were not discussed at all, including equity, and user involvement.
Conclusion
This paper highlights the scarcity of discussion around ethical issues. Both researchers and developers need to better integrate ethical reflection at each step of the development and use of health apps. More effective oversight mechanisms and clearer ethical guidance are needed to guide the stakeholders in this endeavour.",2021

Notwithstanding its promising nature, however, AI in healthcare embodies certain ethical challenges as well. This research aims to delineate the most influential elements of scientific research on AI ethics in healthcare by conducting bibliometric, social network analysis, and cluster-based content analysis of scientific articles. Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare. Practically, this research will provide a map for policymakers and AI engineers and scientists on what dimensions of AI-based medical interventions require stricter policies and guidelines and robust ethical design and development.",2021

However, this potential adoption bubble may get diminished by the uncontrolled fragility in market conditions and persuasive increase in potential contemporary security concerns. In this survey, we systematically examine the state-of-the-art associated with security concerns in cryptocurrencies from various perspectives.

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), or Industry 4.0, is the industrial application of IoT. Industry 4.0 transforms production equipment into IoTs, which in turn transmit production-related data or their operational status to other connected devices or servers for rapid storage or processing. The results of the processing are used in real-time for the control and supervision of the production system. With the time constraints related to the availability of the processing results, companies have more and more computing servers. These IoT application computing servers are the fog. While processing IoT application data, fog servers require cloud intervention to offload tasks to free them up and provide data storage. Edge computing joins the game when connected objects are themselves computing resources. One of the main challenges of these technologies is the scheduling of dependent/independent tasks. Scheduling IoT workflows in the fog to optimize quality of service (QoS) metrics often requires offloading some tasks to the cloud in order to meet customer satisfaction and service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Therefore, many algorithms have been developed to schedule workflows in the cloud-fog environment. To organize this research, we present a literature review on scheduling workflows in cloud, fog, and edge environments. We outline a taxonomy that systematically classifies existing approaches.

COVID-19 is disrupting and transforming the world. We argue that transformations catalysed by this pandemic should be used to improve human and planetary health and wellbeing. This paradigm shift requires decision makers and policy makers to go beyond building back better, by nesting the economic domain of sustainable development within social and environmental domains. Drawing on the engage, assess, align, accelerate, and account (E4As) approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we explore the implications of this kind of radical transformative change, focusing particularly on the role of the health sector. We conclude that a recovery and transition from the COVID-19 pandemic that delivers the future humanity wants and needs requires more than a technical understanding of the transformation at hand. It also requires commitment and courage from leaders and policy makers to challenge dominant constructs and to work towards a truly thriving, equitable, and sustainable future to create a world where economic development is not an end goal itself, but a means to secure the health and wellbeing of people and the planet.",2021

To address this problem, we propose a universal computational experiment framework with a fine-grained artificial society that is integrated with data-based models. The purpose of the framework is to evaluate the consequences of various combinations of strategies geared towards reaching a Pareto optimum with regards to efficacy versus costs. As an example, by modeling coronavirus disease 2019 mitigation, we show that Pareto frontier nations could achieve better economic growth and more effective epidemic control through the analysis of real-world data. Our work suggests that a nation’s intervention strategy could be optimized based on the measures adopted by Pareto frontier nations through large-scale computational experiments. Our solution has been validated for epidemic control, and it can be generalized to other urban issues as well.",2022

Yet, strategies for this integration remain a key challenge for urban planners and city administrators. Using a scientometric and systematic literature review approach, the objective of this review is to examine the state-of-the-art and current research gaps that constrain such integration. We find that while interests in the interrelationships between solar energy and urban planning have spanned several decades, the two remain largely unintegrated. Though a socio-technical process, the socio-political and socio-demographic aspects of solar urban planning have not received much scholarly attention. Consequently, whereas many software tools for analyzing solar insolation on existing surfaces have been developed, there is a lack of methods and decision support systems to integrate the results into urban planning practice. There is limited research on the subject in the global South despite significant opportunities for solar urban planning in this region. Also, a limited application of theoretical frameworks was found in existing studies. Future research exploring solar urban planning from the socio-technical transition theoretical perspective will significantly enhance the realization of this concept.",2022

Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.",2020

So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain.

This systematic literature review aims to explore the evidence for using these approaches in a concerted manner to better manage zoonoses. By zoonoses management, we refer to improving the ability to address current zoonoses as well as preventing future ones. A total of 98 scientific articles were screened, of which 29 were considered eligible due to their focus on operationalizing each approach to help address zoonoses, as well as a combination of the two. Most articles implement One Health to prevent zoonoses by guiding stakeholders in concerted and participatory decision-making processes. However, the One Health approach can also be adopted via data modelling. Several articles refer to the monitoring and evaluation process of One Health initiatives to prevent zoonoses and discuss best practices to successfully implement the approach. Contrastingly, only three studies adopt a Food System approach to manage zoonoses, despite the profound connections existing between our food systems and the emergence of zoonotic risks. We conclude that there is a lack of integration between the One Health and Food System approaches to manage zoonoses. We also show that experts call for integration, so that not only human, animal, plant, and environmental health are considered, but also the socio-economic trade-offs when monitoring and developing strategies to manage zoonoses. This can be reversed, enabling zoonotic risks to be addressed when planning for our food systems of tomorrow.",2024

The findings reveal that while digital tools are pivotal in design and construction phases, their application to existing structures is less straightforward, with challenges including the absence of digital twins for demolished structures, the high costs of retrofit digitalisation, and the predominant focus on environmental benefits over practical implementation. The review also highlights the need for a unified digital transformation strategy and greater cross-industry collaboration.

Therefore, EbA presents a potential for more comprehensive, cost-efficient, multifunctional and multidimensional measures in flood disaster risk management. Essentially, EbA integrates biodiversity and ecosystem services as an approach to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This study adopts descriptive and exploratory analytical approaches aimed at assessing the trends of flood events in South Africa and their potential risk management through EbA. The study reveals that between 1959 and 2019, several major floods have occurred, resulting in losses of life and livelihoods and significant infrastructure damages among others. Recovery has taken years and needed continuous investment. Unfortunately, many communities have not been able to “bounce back/bounce forward”, despite all these efforts. This study revealed that EbA strategies can be instituted regionally and nationally to offer efficient flood disaster adaptation or mitigation in flood-prone areas. In general, utilising EbA can stabilise or reduce flood impacts, minimise environmental impacts and damages associated with flood disasters by developing innovative EbA strategies. Therefore, the study recommends an increased awareness of EbA strategies to enhance universal adoption in ameliorating flood risk.",2022

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and global impact on health care, and has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technology. One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger.

This is important as recognizing definitions, rights, and obligations in the regulatory world, for the energy community actors, such as citizen/renewable energy communities, active consumers, and renewables self-consumers, is vital to energy community development. This enables evaluating the comprehensiveness of regulations for functionality of the realized technical counterparts, namely microgrids, energy hubs, virtual power plants, and prosumers. By mapping the energy community actors to realized technical counterparts, the key finding of this study is that for certain cases, a right, an activity sector, or a technical feature necessitates matching to an energy community actor with a broader activity domain. This brings unnecessary rights and obligations to the intended realized technical counterpart. However, technical features prevent claiming those rights or meeting additional obligations. The study is then extended to national legislation of selected European countries, i.e., Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, and Spain. Regulatory misalignments or improvements in comparison to the European legislation are also reported. To address benefits and barriers associated with energy communities, a survey on collective energy actors (e.g., municipalities, private sector suppliers, city councils, energy service companies, etc) involved in energy transition is conducted. The key finding of the survey is that rather than economic benefits, achieving renewable targets and participating in energy-based social activities such as improving the energy efficiency are the primary motivations behind energy community initiatives.",2023

Although there are several reviews on SST, the aviation industry has been comparatively overlooked. This study offers a systematic review of the existing literature on aviation SST (e.g., self-check-in kiosks and web/e-ticketing) from the customer service perspective. Starting from a rich dataset of 678 peer-reviewed journal articles listed in Scopus, after some screening processes, 98 articles remained and were included in the full-text review and analysis. Accordingly, we found that the aviation SST literature focused on some geographical locations, e.g., North America and Asia, but not others (e.g., Africa or Oceania). Its three main research themes are customer adoption, customer satisfaction, and customer experience, in which the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the dominant framework. In addition, the use of SST from the environmental perspective was rarely studied while newer SSTs such as customer service chatbots and biometric check-in will need more attention.",2024

The circular economy (CE) paradigm appears more focused regarding goals and agency to address environmental issues by using the economic system. However, companies and governments aiming to operationalize CE in practice, it has been claimed, will face six key challenges limiting the CE “net sustainability impact” potential. This work focuses on the challenges for manufacturers to adopt and operationalize CE for their business. The two key levers for manufacturers to navigate on their path from the linear (take-make-dispose) to a sustainable CE are innovating and designing of the business model and of their products. To date, however, understanding the role of product design in developing circular business models has received little attention in research. This review article builds upon the CE literature foundation, including definitions, challenges, and business modeling frameworks needed to better understand the role of product design. Building on the work of several highly cited CE-centric literature reviews and voices in research and industry, we selected and merged complementing frameworks: Slowing-Closing-Narrowing, Circular Design, and the Circular Business Model Innovation framework. To understand how to put these frameworks into practice, we analyzed CE's links with electric vehicle and white goods research and industry perspectives respectively and collectively. The review and analysis of CE and selected industries’ research was supported by a co-occurrence keyword analysis of 5,960 most cited papers in CE as well as the two product categories, electric vehicles and white goods. The analysis indicated limited maturity and linkage of circular business models and role of product design toward a CE in the research literature for the product categories. This result corroborated the knowledge gap and guided our focus in searching for further research and industry clues. We structured the clues of interest that were specific to or common across product categories and industries, using the integrated framework to visualize our Design for X conclusion. The merged framework visualizes how paths toward CE by design and logic of value creation, delivery, and capturing may differ. To conclude, the authors’ own experience and literature examples from relevant industry-leading and start-up companies are used to apply the framework and reveal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Future research and industry experiments focused on the circular business models based on product service systems and design for CE strategies identified, will be needed to test and extend the framework to other product categories and industry sectors.",2021

Solid waste and its associated environmental, health and wellbeing impacts and resource and land availability are becoming increasingly challenging to manage in remote and isolated communities. This is primarily due to the lack of infrastructure, land availability, high collection cost, poor economies of scale and low environmental awareness. This paper seeks to understand the factors that contribute to this solid waste management challenge and that hinder more sustainable management in a remote community context, through a systematic and critical literature review. 265 scientific articles and industry and government reports were collected and reviewed from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google search from 2011 to 2021. Barriers and enablers were synthesised and critically reviewed using a systematic literature review approach following the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. The review identified a lack of waste collection and recycling infrastructure, increasing trade and local economic development, low environmental awareness with respect to impacts of consumer waste products and disposal, and limited access to funding as the major drivers for the current unsustainable waste problem in remote communities. Notable impacts literature identified include water pollution (including marine environments), land pollution, and air pollution. Six categories of responses reported in the literature are: 1) technological improvements, 2) waste avoidance and reduction, 3) reuse and recycle, 4) increase government support, 5) inter-organisation partnership, and 6) innovative solutions to create value from waste. This paper informs policy makers on existing problems and potential circular economy approaches to achieve greater sustainability in this area. The paper also provides recommendations on a future research agenda to achieve such changes on the ground.",2023

Consequently, research on ICT/digitization and their impact on environmental sustainability has witnessed exponential growth in the last few decades. This study provides a systematic review of the relationship between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability over the period from January 2000 to April 2022. It aimed to improve our understanding of the different theories and channels governing the ICT/digitization–environmental sustainability nexus, to provide an in-depth analysis and discussion of the trends and main empirical findings of the reviewed articles, and to highlight key avenues for future research. In total, 166 scientific articles examining 297 associations between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability were selected for this review. The results revealed that most of the studies have used measures based on climate change and air pollution for environmental sustainability, and traditional ICT/digitization measures, e.g., mobile phone subscriptions and internet users. The results also showed that although most studies found evidence for ICT/digitization improving environmental sustainability, evidence for a negative association is concentrated in studies on the ’Group of’ countries. The results also revealed a scarcity of studies investigating nonlinear relationships between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability.",2023

These sustainability assessment methods vary in their scope, target audience, selection of sustainability themes and indicators, aggregation and time requirements. This review paper focuses on farm-level sustainability assessment tools (or farm-level Decision Support Tools (DSTs)). Such farm-level DSTs are generally characterized by their user-friendliness and reliance on simplified models with limited complexity. They are often considered useful for non-scientific decision-makers. However, there is limited understanding of the consistency of these DSTs with the principles and normative aspects of sustainability assessment. This study has reviewed 19 DSTs to characterize the common methodological choices that tool developers made. Each of these tools was then reviewed with respect to the Bellagio Sustainability Assessment and Measuring Principles (STAMP). The results showed that tool developers are often faced with trade-offs across different methodological choices such as scope of application, geographic scope, type of modelling and level of assessment. Our findings also revealed that only three of the 19 tools considered were at least partially consistent with all of the Bellagio principles. In order to ensure compliance with the principles of sustainability assessment, tool developers should start from a clear guiding vision of sustainability, explicitly understand and communicate essential considerations, improve transparency with respect to methodological decisions and better integrate the end-users into the tool development process.",2020

In this context, agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is becoming one of the prominent computational modelling approaches for studying CESs. However, no systematic and critical review of such models has been conducted. Therefore, this study investigates the studies that used ABMS to study CESs, comprehensively analyse and structure this branch of literature, and suggest future research avenues. The six following elements from the Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) are used: (i) modelling purposes, (ii) agents and their variables, (iii) concepts and theories, (iv) initialisation and narrative, (v) network structures and interactions, and (vi) input data. The analysis demonstrated that particular purposes (e.g. social learning) and specific agents (e.g., energy companies) are neglected in the modelling practices. Furthermore, the developed ABMS are mainly focused on economic discipline, including topics such as local market design, and topics related to environmental and behavioural/institutional disciplines are largely missing. Such domination also reflects on the narratives and the networks used in the modelling.

Current urban and transport planning practices have significant negative health, environmental, social and economic impacts in most cities. New urban development models and policies are needed to reduce these negative impacts. The Superblock model is one such innovative urban model that can significantly reduce these negative impacts through reshaping public spaces into more diverse uses such as increase in green space, infrastructure supporting social contacts and physical activity, and through prioritization of active mobility and public transport, thereby reducing air pollution, noise and urban heat island effects. This paper reviews key aspects of the Superblock model, its implementation and initial evaluations in Barcelona and the potential international uptake of the model in Europe and globally, focusing on environmental, climate, lifestyle, liveability and health aspects.
Methods
We used a narrative meta-review approach and PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched using specific terms.
Results
The implementation of the Super block model in Barcelona is slow, but with initial improvement in, for example, environmental, lifestyle, liveability and health indicators, although not so consistently. When applied on a large scale, the implementation of the Superblock model is not only likely to result in better environmental conditions, health and wellbeing, but can also contribute to the fight against the climate crisis. There is a need for further expansion of the program and further evaluation of its impacts and answers to related concerns, such as environmental equity and gentrification, traffic and related environmental exposure displacement. The implementation of the Superblock model gained a growing international reputation and variations of it are being planned or implemented in cities worldwide. Initial modelling exercises showed that it could be implemented in large parts of many cities.
Conclusion
The Superblock model is an innovative urban model that addresses environmental, climate, liveability and health concerns in cities. Adapted versions of the Barcelona Superblock model are being implemented in cities around Europe and further implementation, monitoring and evaluation are encouraged. The Superblock model can be considered an important public health intervention that will reduce mortality and morbidity and generate cost savings for health and other sectors.",2024

In this review we highlight the challenges facing energy networks from this transition in a sample of key high income countries. We identify the technical and other innovations being implemented to meet these challenges and describe some of the new policy and regulatory developments that are incentivising the required changes. We then review evidence from the literature about the benefits of moving to a more integrated approach based on the concept of a Multi-Vector Energy Network (MVEN). Under this approach the different networks are planned and operated together to achieve greater functionality and performance than simply the sum of the individual networks. We find that most studies identify a range of benefits from an MVEN approach, but that these findings are based on model simulations. Further work is therefore needed to verify whether the benefits can be realised in practice and to identify how any risks can be mitigated.",2023

Moreover, there has been limited use cases of blockchain at horizontal level, such as decentralized finance (de-fi), enabling fishers to gain capital access and entering global markets. Overall, enhancing the adoption of blockchain should address suitability, incentives, and trust factors in using blockchain. As future prospects, projects in fishery and aquaculture could better utilize the full potential of blockchains by (1) incorporating financing, capital, and insurance through de-fi solutions, (2) providing tangible incentives, and (3) using automation such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) in data collection to improve quality and trust in data.",2023

However, exchanging data in markets bears considerable challenges related to disclosing sensitive information. Despite considerable research focused on different aspects of privacy-enhancing data markets for the IoT, none of the solutions proposed so far seems to find a practical adoption. Thus, this study aims to organize the state-of-the-art solutions, analyze and scope the technologies that have been suggested in this context, and structure the remaining challenges to determine areas where future research is required. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a systematic literature review on privacy enhancement in data markets for the IoT, covering 50 publications dated up to July 2020, and provided updates with 24 publications dated up to May 2022. Our results indicate that most research in this area has emerged only recently, and no IoT data market architecture has established itself as canonical. Existing solutions frequently lack the required combination of anonymization and secure computation technologies. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the appropriate use of blockchain technology for IoT data markets and a low degree of leveraging existing libraries or reusing generic data market architectures. We also identified significant challenges remaining, such as the copy problem and the recursive enforcement problem that – while solutions have been suggested to some extent – are often not sufficiently addressed in proposed designs. We conclude that privacy-enhancing technologies need further improvements to positively impact data markets so that, ultimately, the value of data is preserved through data scarcity and users’ privacy and businesses-critical information are protected.",2022

This era is witnessing an unprecedented transformation driven by pressing concerns related to sustainability, climate change, the just energy transition, dynamic operating environments, and complex social challenges. Such transitions present both opportunities and obstacles. The aim of this study is to provide an extensive literature review on energy transition to identify the challenges and strategies associated with navigating transformations in energy systems. Understanding these transformations is particularly critical in the face of the severe consequences of global warming, where an accelerated energy transition is viewed as a universal remedy. Adopting a socio-technological systems perspective, specifically through the application of Actor Network Theory (ANT), this research provides a theoretical foundation while categorising challenges into five distinct domains and outlining strategies across these different dimensions. These insights are specifically tailored for emerging market countries to effectively navigate energy transition while fostering the development of resilient societies. Furthermore, our findings highlight that energy transition encompasses more than a mere technological shift; it entails fundamental changes in various systemic socio-economic imperatives. Through focusing on the role of social structures in transitions, this study makes a significant and innovative contribution to ANT, which has historically been criticised for its limited acknowledgement of social structures. Consequently, we propose an emerging market energy transition framework, which not only addresses technological aspects, but also integrates social considerations. This framework paves the way for future research and exploration of energy transition dynamics. The outcomes of this study offer valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners engaged in the mining industry, enabling them to comprehend the multifaceted challenges involved and providing practical strategies for effective resolution.

Such integration is particularly important in view of recent calls to examine the evolving ontological nature of IT, wherein IT artifacts are now shaping physical reality. We systematically examine innovation-related literature published in the leading IS journals in the period between 2009 and 2020 and we identify and summarize the core theoretical discourses in this domain. We find that extant literature largely examines the role of IT in innovation at a high level of abstraction, focusing on IT investments and IT capabilities, and consequently precluding granular insights on who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to organizational innovation. To address this limitation and to provide a structuring lens for future research, we develop the organizational innovation system framework which posits that actors, IT artifacts, actions and organizational context are the key elements in organizational innovation systems that require more granular examination to yield deeper insights on how information technology contributes to organizational innovation. We re-examine the literature through the organizational innovation system lens and we identify gaps in extant research. We also outline potential directions for expanding the scope of future research.",2021

This paper examines how the pandemic caused a water security crisis for many communities, and in so doing, our analysis contributes to current debates on water system resilience and continued challenges of water affordability in the United States. Water utilities faced major shifts in industrial and domestic water demand, financial burdens of increased non-payments, and operational challenges due to a reduced workforce and supply chain bottlenecks. Areas of concern include customer protection, financial security, public communication, new technology adoption, and trust. Evidence indicates that the pandemic water crisis spurred institutional and technological innovation to increase resilience for the next shock while overall financial challenges in the post-pandemic years remain. The pandemic water crisis also revealed a stark tradeoff between household water security and water utility security, indicating that without systemic changes to policy and practice related to water affordability, the most vulnerable in the United States will continue to suffer in future crises.",2023

Globally, to address similar issues and unlock a region's energy potential, regional integrated energy systems have gained traction, and initiatives such as establishing power pools for regional electricity markets, cross-border power exchanges, and integrating renewable energy resources are being promoted. This paper describes the status of regional integrated energy systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. We analyze the energy growth achieved through effective strategies and policies that support regional integrated energy systems in developed and developing regions (the United Kingdom and China). Our findings show that challenges, including limited access to financing, regulatory barriers, lack of effective energy planning model, inadequate supporting policies, and fragmented institutional frameworks, hinder the region's widespread deployment of regional integrated energy systems. Taking lessons from the case studies, addressing SSA's energy challenges requires concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, and the private sector to create enabling policy environments, mobilize investments, and build technical capacity and supporting infrastructures. Regional integrated energy systems can enhance energy security by diversifying energy sources, fostering economic development, and stimulating cross-border energy trade. In the United Kingdom, the implementation of integrated energy systems has contributed to a 25% reduction in carbon emissions and a 15% increase in energy efficiency over the past decade. Similarly, in China, the integration of renewable energy sources into regional energy systems has led to a 30% increase in renewable energy capacity and a 20% decrease in coal consumption since 2010. China owns 32% of global renewable energy market, alongside an installed capacity of about 1.26 TW in the first quarter of 2023. Our findings from the power pools indicate that three out of the four pools possess significant hydro energy resources. Specifically, within the CAPP region, 7 out of 10 countries heavily rely on hydro energy, while in EAPP, 6 out of 11 countries exhibit a similar dependency. Moreover, within SAPP, 9 out of 12 countries and within WAPP, 5 out of 14 countries rely significantly on hydro energy.",2024

This is evident from the exponential growth of ESS demand in recent years. The global energy storage capacity is expected to exceed 1000 GW by 2040. In Malaysia, it is predicted that there will be rapid growth of ESSs in line with the goal to achieve the renewable energy penetration target of 31 % by 2025. The growth of renewable energy in Malaysia is mainly driven by solar energy, owing to its strategic location in the tropics. In this regard, ESSs are seen as the key enabler that can promote solar hosting in Malaysia by alleviating the technical issues arising from their integration. In this study, a comprehensive review on the benefits of ESSs in power systems is first presented and the research gap associated with ESS-solar photovoltaic integration is highlighted. Subsequently, the key opportunities and applicability of ESSs in Malaysia's power systems are identified and discussed. Furthermore, the potential development phases of ESSs are classified for the period from 2020 to 2035, considering the renewable energy development scenarios in Malaysia.

CONTEXT
Narratives dominate the agricultural discourse that digitalisation is the ‘silver bullet’ to agricultural, environmental, and global issues, resulting in an external push towards automation and a rapid increase in digital technologies in the sector. Concentrated productivist views and techno-optimist hype and momentum is carrying us briskly towards a digital farming revolution, with little conversation or consideration of the social impacts of digitalisation. The application of social science research to digital agriculture is relatively new and the pace at which it has been developing to keep up with digital advances in the sector has left this body of literature scattered and lacking sufficient overview.
OBJECTIVE
To address this, a scoping study was conducted on social and behavioural science literature related to digital agriculture.
METHODS
This scoping study, which incorporates 200 references, pays particular attention to stakeholder engagement and how agricultural digitalisation has been developing. This methodology enables us to provide an extensive overview of this field of research, presenting key themes pertaining to the literature including barriers and facilitators of, as well as anticipated positive and negative impacts of digital technology adoption.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We find that whilst there has been a general win-win, techno-positive narrative in the agricultural sector, proof of these benefits is limited and some technologies are eliciting negative effects to its users, transforming the landscape of agriculture.
SIGNIFICANCE
In order to be responsive to these negative consequences, it is important that we turn our attention upstream to examine how technologies are designed and developed for use in an agricultural context. This can be achieved by integrating more inclusive approaches to technology design. These approaches will help to mitigate negative effects of technologies, help to create successful and responsible innovations, tackle low adoption issues, and help to create more responsible digital futures.",2023

Over the last several years, our research group has adopted biomaterials-based regenerative engineering strategies using innovative bioelectronic stimulation protocols based on either electric or magnetic stimuli to direct cellular differentiation on engineered biomaterials with a range of elastic stiffness or functional properties (electroactivity/magnetoactivity). In this article, the role of bioelectronics in stem cell-based regenerative engineering has been critically analyzed to stimulate futuristic research in the treatment of degenerative diseases as well as to address some fundamental questions in stem cell biology. Built on the concepts from two independent biomedical research domains (regenerative engineering and bioelectronic medicine), we propose a converging research theme, ‘Regenerative Bioelectronics’. Further, a series of recommendations have been put forward to address the current challenges in bridging the gap in stem cell therapy and bioelectronic medicine.

To evaluate the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on the implementation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) through a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517375).
Participants and Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and grey literature from January 2010 to February 2024, focusing on IMCI/iCCM-related terms and excluding non-ICT interventions. A meta-analysis synthesized the impact of ICT on clinical assessment, disease classification, therapy, and antibiotic prescription through Odds Ratio (OR; 95%CI) employing a random-effects model for significant heterogeneity (I2>50%) and conducting subgroup analyses.
Results
Of 1,005 initial studies, 44 were included, covering eight interventions for IMCI, seven for iCCM, and two for training. All digital interventions except one outperformed traditional paper-based methods. Pooling effect sizes from 16 studies showed 5·7 OR for more complete clinical assessments (95%CI:1·7-19·1, I2 95%); 2·0 for improved disease classification accuracy (95%CI:0·9-4·4, I2 93%); 1·4 for more appropriate therapy (95%CI:0·8-2·2, I2 93%); and 0·2 for reduced antibiotic use (95%CI:0·06-0·55, I2 99%).
Conclusion
This review is the first to comprehensively quantify the impact of ICT on the implementation of IMCI/iCCM programs, confirming both the benefits and limitations of these technologies. The customization of digital tools for IMCI/iCCM can serve as a model for other health programs. As ICT increasingly supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, the effective digital interventions identified in this review can pave the way for future innovations.",2024

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks.
Objective
This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity.
Methods
A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development's roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework.
Results
The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity. Despite considerable funding and a variety of approaches to the development of an AI in health supporting ecosystem, only the United Kingdom and United States have reached the highest level of maturity, an integrated and collaborative AI in health ecosystem (Level 3).
Conclusion
Despite policymakers looking for opportunities to expedite efforts related to AI, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure the sustainable development and safe use of AI in health. The principles of equifinality and mindfulness must thus guide policymaking in the development of AI in health care.",2024

Collective targets set by private, government, and non-government organizations to achieve global “zero net deforestation” by 2020 have been missed. Here, we explore the limitations of zero deforestation (ZD) targets and commitments. We review the origins of the ZD concept and explore conceptual and practical challenges with attaining ZD. Conceptual challenges include problems with defining “forest,” social equity, and agricultural expansion leaking to non-forest ecosystems. Practical challenges include implementing ZD in highly complex supply chains. We reflect on the framing of ZD and discuss principles to support post-2020 conservation targets and commitments. We emphasize the importance of defining relationships between global goals and targets, national targets, and commitments. We call for research to understand the impacts of ZD commitments on local stakeholders in diverse contexts, including highly forested landscapes. Reframing ZD will not solve deforestation, but reflecting on its limitations could support more effective and equitable tropical forest conservation beyond 2020.",2020

On the basis of ensuring the safety and stability of the power system, it distributed energy provides effective energy utilization and intelligent control to promote low-carbon, ecological, and intelligent development. This eased the difficulty of implementing the concept of sustainable development in national ecological renewal design, economic development, and energy conservation and environmental protection. Under the traditional urban planning system, there is no comprehensive energy plan except for special plans such as electricity, gas, and thermal engineering, which shows that in the traditional urban planning system, the understanding of energy development and utilization is still very weak. Air pollution caused by energy consumption is becoming more and more serious, energy demand is increasing rapidly, and more and more attention is paid to urban energy. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the emphasis on energy development and comprehensive utilization in the design of eco-city, and make it suitable for urban renewal design. At the same time, this paper also conducts a more in-depth discussion on the types of energy planning and the characteristics of eco-city.

Researchers and sector stakeholders increasingly realize that this container market segment has its distinct dynamics and demands. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the reefer container sector, its most important characteristics and trends, and a systematic review of the academic literature on reefer containers and logistics. First the authors outline the characteristics, composition, and development of the reefer container market, showing its growth through modal shift (from conventional reefer ships and airfreight) and differentiation into new cargo markets and niche services. Secondly the authors outline reefer chains in terms of their relevant stages, stakeholders, and processes. Data on insurance claims shows that cold chain failure and cargo loss not only occur due to technical failures, but just as often due to organizational errors – especially due to hold-up risk at container transfer points. Thirdly the authors map the present knowledge on reefer containers and reefer transportation through a systematic literature review. The current body of research on reefer containers consists mostly of highly specialized, technical studies on product characteristics and quality preservation, monitoring and control, refrigeration technology, and temperature management. While technological advances in these fields have largely enabled the containerization of cold logistics chains, the first sections of this paper also highlight that many current pressing issues in reefer transportation are logistical and organizational in nature. Therefore, the authors propose a research agenda addressing these overlooked aspects, including supply chain coordination issues and implications of reefer market developments for port policy.",2020

The data collection has been carried out through the Web of Science™ platform on September 3rd, 2021. After a refinement process, 41 papers were selected. The descriptive analysis was carried out through Bibliometrix tool, while content analysis was performed using Nvivo. The descriptive analysis shows that from 2016 to 2021 the scientific production addressing multi-criteria methods to assess agricultural sustainability started to grow markedly in a very rapid matter, reaching an average of 6 papers per year. France and China are the most scientifically productive countries. The content analysis points out that the most used multi-criteria method is the AHP that was used 11 times. The outranking methods, instead, were used only 3 times. In 68% of the papers the Triple Bottom Line was used as dimensions, and in 41% of the papers the spatial applicability was the farming system. The results highlight that doesn’t exist many MCDM/A methods for assessing agricultural sustainability, and most of them are compensatory. These results point out that the use of multi-criteria methods in assessing agricultural sustainability is still underexplored and can be improved.",2022

Model aggregation, also known as model fusion, plays a vital role in FL. It involves combining locally generated models from client devices into a single global model while maintaining user data privacy. However, the accuracy and reliability of the resulting global model depend on the aggregation method chosen, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial. Initially, the simple averaging of model weights was the most commonly used method. However, due to its limitations in handling low-quality or malicious models, alternative techniques have been explored. As FL gains popularity in various domains, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the available model aggregation techniques and their respective strengths and limitations. However, there is currently a significant gap in the literature when it comes to systematic and comprehensive reviews of these techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review encompassing 201 studies on model aggregation in FL. The focus is on summarizing the proposed techniques and the ones currently applied for model fusion. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to enhance and develop new aggregation techniques, as well as for practitioners to select the most appropriate method for their FL applications.",2024

Nevertheless, given the high rates of failure of e-government services, it is critical to understand the factors that are essential to the success of a digital tax system. Drawing on a systematic review of ninety-six publications across the digital taxation, taxation, and information systems (IS) literature, a comprehensive conceptual framework is developed to improve our success of digital services in tax administration. The conceptual framework identifies fifteen themes for consideration by policymakers when designing digital services in tax administrations clustered around four categories – Context, Stakeholders, Technology and Demonstrated Results. The framework should also serve as a reference point in successfully developing strategies and measures to embed digital services in tax administrations. Future research directions are also proposed based on the conceptual framework that will help advance our understanding of digital services in tax administration beyond technology acceptance models.",2022

The Chinese government promises to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and strives to achieve carbon neutralization by 2060. The proposal of the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutralization has led China into the era of climate economy and set off a green change with both opportunities and challenges. On the basis of expounding the objectives and specific connotation of China’s carbon peak and carbon neutralization, this paper systematically discusses the main implementation path and the prospect of China’s carbon peak and carbon neutralization. China’s path to realizing carbon neutralization includes four directions: (1) in terms of carbon dioxide emission control: energy transformation path, energy conservation, and emission reduction path; (2) for increasing carbon sink: carbon capture, utilization, and storage path, ecological governance, and land greening path; (3) in key technology development: zero-carbon utilization, coal new energy coupling, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), energy storage technology and other key technology paths required to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutralization; (4) from the angle of policy development: Formulate legal guarantees for the government to promote the carbon trading market; Formulate carbon emission standards for enterprises and increase publicity and education for individuals and society. Based on practicing the goal and path of carbon peak and carbon neutralization, China will vigorously develop low carbon and circular economy and promote green and high-quality economic development; speed up to enter the era of fossil resources and promoting energy transformation; accelerate the integrated innovation of green and low-carbon technologies and promote carbon neutrality. ©2021 China Geology Editorial Office.",2021

Monitoring and evaluation of MSP is key to inform best practices, adaptive management and plan iteration. While standardised evaluation frameworks cannot be readily applied, accounting for evaluation essentials such as the definition of evaluation objectives, indicators and stakeholder engagement of stakeholders is a prerequisite for meaningful evaluation outcomes. By way of a literature review and eleven practical MSP case studies, we analysed present day trends in evaluation approaches and unravelled the adoption of evaluation essentials for three categories for monitoring and evaluation for plan making, plan outcomes, and policy implementation. We found that at a global scale the focus of MSP evaluation has shifted over the past decade from evaluating predominantly plan outcomes towards the evaluation of plan making. Independent of the scope of the evaluation, evaluation approaches varied greatly from formal and structured processes, building for instance on MSP goals and objectives, to informal processes based on stakeholder interviews. We noted a trend in the adoption of formalised approaches where MSP evaluations have increasingly become linked to MSP policy goals and objectives. However, the enhanced use of MSP objectives and indicators did not result in a more straightforward reporting of outcomes, e.g. such as the achievement of specific MSP objectives. Overall, we found weak linkages between defined MSP objectives, indicators and available monitoring data. While the apparent shift towards a focus on objectives is promising, we highlight the need of fit-for-purpose monitoring data to enable effective evaluation of those objectives. Hence, effective MSP and adaptive management processes require customised and concurrent monitoring and evaluation strategies and procedures. We argue that evaluation processes would also benefit from a better understanding of the general environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural effects of MSP. Therefore, to understand better environmental effects of MSP, we praise that forthcoming MSP processes need to deepen the understanding and considerations of cause-effect pathways between human activities and changes of ecosystem state through the adoption of targeted cumulative effects assessments.",2021

As a result, there is increasing interest in supporting reef resilience through restoration and adaptation interventions. Different options have been developed, each with differing impacts on the social-ecological system. Choosing which, if any, option to implement requires assessment of their expected performance against a potentially wide range of objectives. We propose an objectives framework that can help decision analysts and decision makers map intervention options and their consequences to what matters for reefs and people. We present an example hierarchy of strategic and tactical fundamental and means objectives for reef restoration. We show that such an objectives hierarchy in conjunction with the modelling of option performance allows restoration choices to be identified that can meet reef management objectives and produce desired outcomes for reef-dependent communities, other stakeholders, and members of society more broadly. Example objectives are derived from government and marine park policy documents as well as a broader set of related academic literature. We show that a hierarchy of clear and well-defined objectives linked to ecological, economic and social values is central to informing multi-objective decision making.",2024

Clinicians have worked feverishly to treat patients with COVID-19 while also carrying out clinical research studies. We discuss how the clinical research community responded to the pandemic in Europe, what lessons were learned, and provide recommendations for future clinical research response during pandemics. We focused on two platform trials: RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP. Both trials were able to enrol patients very rapidly during the beginning of the pandemic because of pre-established structures and procedures, and because they share simple execution and flexibility to adjust when evidence emergences. However, contracting, regulatory hurdles, and competition with (often inadequately designed or underpowered) national trials was a major challenge in several EU countries. We recommend the creation of structures and partnerships that facilitate prioritisation of clinical research, simplification of clinical trial delivery, development of digital models and procedures for data collection and sharing, development of a mechanism to rapidly leverage pandemic funding and to connect EU funding with national funding, and investment in clinical trial networks, platform trials, and master protocols. Finally, the future pandemic clinical research response of the EU should be embedded in the global response. We believe that globally connected clinical trial networks will be essential to respond more effectively to future infectious diseases outbreaks.",2022

However, public involvement tends to be highly localized and procedural, aimed at informing local stakeholders and gaining their acceptance for implementation. At the same time, other ways of engaging the public have emerged that move beyond invited stakeholder participation to facilitate the co-production of wind energy technologies and the landscapes in which they are placed. This paper systematically reviews the academic literature with the aim of identifying and characterizing these modes of co-production. A total of 230 papers published between 2009 and 2019 that report on public engagement with wind energy were included in our review. From this sample, we characterise public engagement into three modes of co-production: (1) local co-production, in spatially proximate wind energy projects; (2) collective co-production, performed through collaboration among different actors in the wind energy sector, joined ownership or consumption of wind energy; and (3) virtual co-production, mediated through information technology. These different modes of co-production cover a broad spectrum of ways in which local and non-local publics engage in decisions about where, when, how and by whom wind energy projects are designed, developed and managed over time. Combined, they can offer guidance for future research on how the wind energy sector can further support a transition to sustainable and inclusive energy systems.",2021

Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in distributed computing platform applications based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%.

Current practices in a linear economy—produce, consume, discard—will not be sufficient to sustain humanity over the long term. At the same time manufacturing is necessary to support the world's ever-growing population. The efficiencies of scale that manufacturing brings to bear on the global economy allow greater sharing of services and resources. Research and practices supporting sustainable manufacturing are necessary to control impacts on the environment. From an engineering perspective, however, those practices are in their infancy.Small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMM) make up the majority of manufacturing firms globally, but many are still unsure of whether and how to embrace sustainability as a driving business imperative. In this study, we explore two interconnected approaches to address sustainability: the benefits of investing in sustainability initiatives for SMM and the use of standards to support such initiatives. In so doing, we analyze reported barriers to SMM pursuing sustainability, the value gained from sustainability-focused operational improvements within SMM, and the benefits of grounding those improvements in standards. The results indicate that 1) reported beliefs surrounding the benefits of pursuing sustainability goals should be refocused in light of the data on business performance and 2) standards developments is foundational to pursuing such objectives. This study examines multiple data sources to reach these conclusions, including open literature, expert interviews, corporate sustainability reports, and performance data across multiple years from programs supporting SMM in improving sustainability performance. The study reviews the role that different standards fill and highlights those that are instrumental in pursuing manufacturing sustainability objectives. While several standards from the business world have emerged to establish industry-specific sustainability disclosures, little guidance is available to manufacturers on how to implement and show improvements to their practices. Recently, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) produced standards to target sustainability goals in specific industrial sectors. Other standards bodies, including ASTM International's E60 Committee on Sustainability and Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing (E60.13), specifically address practical guidance for manufacturing operations in the form of standards. The intent of such standards setting bodies is to make manufacturing more sustainable, yet the organizations have evolved independently. Consequently, their respective standards reflect different types of measures based on the distinct users' perspectives. These and other standards efforts are highlighted as supporting the integration of sustainability goals into manufacturing organizations. These findings demonstrate that (1) integrating sustainability as a business imperative, particularly by SMM, can result in business opportunities and (2) leveraging standards reduces the risk of introducing changes. Future efforts towards more sustainable development can be furthered through the development of voluntary standards for implementing new operational approaches. Such standards can help to engage more SMM in sustainable development by reducing the risk of introducing changes into their existing practices.",2022

Record climate extremes are reducing urban liveability, compounding inequality, and threatening infrastructure. Adaptation measures that integrate technological, nature-based, and social solutions can provide multiple co-benefits to address complex socioecological issues in cities while increasing resilience to potential impacts. However, there remain many challenges to developing and implementing integrated solutions. In this Viewpoint, we consider the value of integrating across the three solution sets, the challenges and potential enablers for integrating solution sets, and present examples of challenges and adopted solutions in three cities with different urban contexts and climates (Freiburg, Germany; Durban, South Africa; and Singapore). We conclude with a discussion of research directions and provide a road map to identify the actions that enable successful implementation of integrated climate solutions. We highlight the need for more systematic research that targets enabling environments for integration; achieving integrated solutions in different contexts to avoid maladaptation; simultaneously improving liveability, sustainability, and equality; and replicating via transfer and scale-up of local solutions. Cities in systematically disadvantaged countries (sometimes referred to as the Global South) are central to future urban development and must be prioritised. Helping decision makers and communities understand the potential opportunities associated with integrated solutions for climate change will encourage urgent and deliberate strides towards adapting cities to the dynamic climate reality.",2021

In sub-Saharan Africa, the impacts of water scarcity threaten livelihoods and wellbeing across the continent and are driving a broad range of adaptive responses. This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low-income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target migrants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa.",2022

New tools, metrics, and methods in agriculture, food systems, and nutrition (A&N) research proliferated in the decade following the 2007–2008 food price crisis. We map these developments across themes derived from conceptual A&N pathways and expert consultations. We created an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) from a systematic search of published and gray literature since 2008, following Campbell Collaboration guidelines. We retrieved over 30,000 reports from published literature databases, and individually searched 20 online repositories. We systematically screened 24,359 reports by title and/or abstract, 1577 by full report, and included 904 eligible reports. The EGM consists of rows of thematic domains and columns of types of tools, metrics, and methods, as well as extensive coding applied as filters. Each cell of the map represents research surrounding a type of tool, metric, or method within a given theme. Reports in each cell are grouped by stage of development, which expand to a corresponding bibliography. Users can filter EGM reports by various characteristics. The 4 most populated domains were: diets, nutrition, and health; primary food production; water, sanitation, and hygiene; and environment and sustainability. The 4 most common types of metrics, methods, and tools were: diet metrics; footprint analysis (especially water); technology applications; and network or Bayesian analysis. Gaps represent areas of few or no reports of innovation between 2008 and 2018. There were gaps in reports and innovations related to: power or conflicts of interest; food environments; markets; private sector engagement; food loss and waste; conflict; study design and system-level tools, metrics, and methods. The EGM is a comprehensive tool to navigate advances in measurement in A&N research: to highlight trends and gaps, conduct further synthesis and development, and prioritize the agenda for future work. This narrative synthesis accompanies the EGM, which can be found at https://www.anh-academy.org/evidence-and-gap-map.",2021

The aim of this article is to review the literature on cruise tourism destinations and to unpack the ways in which sustainability issues are framed at destination level. We have reviewed 98 peer-reviewed empirical journal articles (2015–2022). The article shows how the research literature on cruise tourism and sustainability issues has evolved over 7 years, which aspects of sustainability are considered to be most important and/or problematic and what solutions are suggested to improve the sustainability of cruise tourism. We develop three critical avenues towards sustainable cruise destinations: 1) from specific outcomes to the interconnectedness of desired practices, 2) alternatives to the growth paradigm, and 3) governing for coexistence and the commons. These critical avenues are based on the discussion of what sustainability means for cruise destinations, and translates these into pathways of future research.",2023

We use stylized vignettes of potential NbS to examine how the dimensions of climate justice reveal the potential of NbS to contribute to CRDP. We consider tensions in NbS projects between local and global climate objectives, and the potential for NbS framing to reinforce inequalities or unsustainable practices. Ultimately, we present a framework that combines climate justice and CRDP in an analytical tool for understanding the potential for a NbS to support CRD in specific places.",2023

The unscrupulous usage of water and higher consumption of energy resulted in an uncontrolled generation of wastewater and enormous usage of fossil fuels. In the seafood industry, energy is primarily used for machinery and equipment handling processes such as freezing, refrigeration, heating, cooling, and drying. Similarly, a huge amount of clean water is used for cleaning machinery and plant, and for operations like washing of raw material, de-icing, defrosting, and salt splashing. As a consequence, in the energy-water nexus, additional energy is required for drawing fresh water and further processing of wastewater demands energy that results in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and incurring additional costs to the plant. Hence, this review mainly focuses on the significance of energy and water use optimization in the seafood industry, the existing trend of energy and water use pattern and management practices, optimization strategies, and the seafood-energy-water nexus and its environmental implications.",2021

The discipline of project management is also integrating sustainability issues into its approaches. Under this notion, this study explores the integration of sustainability indicators into project management practices of construction projects. Current literature discloses many indicators/key factors as contributing towards the sustainability success of construction projects. However, the lack of an all-encompassing categorization creates difficulties in directing project managers towards their proper utilization. This paper aims to contribute towards the holistic view of sustainability in project management, especially for construction projects. A systematic literature review was conducted towards the understanding of the key topics and the findings were validated through semi-structured interviews. Eighty-two (82) sustainability indicators related to project management practices in construction projects were finally identified. Their categorization into economic, environmental and social/management sustainability indicators was completed through semi-structured interviews with construction experts and via previous literature analysis. The economic related indicators finalized in 27; 18 for the environmental dimension and 37 indicators were included in the social/management dimension. This study contributes to research on sustainable project management for construction projects in two main ways: (1) it provides a holistic view of sustainable project management indicators, covering the full spectrum of the triple constraint (TBL); (2) it offers the possibility for practitioners to choose the right mix of indicators, depending on the sustainability focus they want to provide in their projects.",2021

Collectively, this prevents an adequate societal response as to how ocean ecosystems and their vital functions for human societies can be protected and restored. We review the confusion surrounding the term “ocean health” and suggest an operational ocean-health framework in line with the concept of strong sustainability. Given the accelerating degeneration of marine ecosystems, the restoration of regional ocean health will be of increasing importance. Our advocated transdisciplinary and multi-actor framework can help to advance the implementation of more active measures to restore ocean health and safeguard human health and well-being.",2020

Many services cancelled all routine appointments and surgery, which allowed them to redirect care towards large numbers of infected patients requiring respiratory and other support. Maternity services are relatively unique in that most of the care is time sensitive and cannot be rescheduled. Assessment such as routine bloods need to be taken in early pregnancy, anatomic surveys are best conducted at 20–22 weeks' gestation, and births continue regardless of a pandemic. In this paper we describe how National Maternity Hospital Dublin, with an annual delivery rate of 8000 births, reorganised services to continue to care for our mothers and babies. This included the development of a ‘hospital within a hospital’ approach, and separate physical and care pathways for positive cases.

With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated ‘upstream’ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed.",2020

In this regard, assessment frameworks can play an essential role and guide resilience-building efforts. However, the lack of a comprehensive assessment framework has led to a focus on sectoral evaluation. This study aims to propose an integrated framework for assessing the pandemic resilience of communities. For this purpose, we rely on a systematic review of literature indexed in major academic databases. We have thoroughly analyzed a total number of 115 related documents to extract relevant criteria. Findings show that many criteria and factors affect community resilience to pandemics. By inductive content coding in MAXQDA software, we have categorized these criteria into five dimensions of Institutional, Social, Economic, Infrastructural, and Demographic. Good leadership and management, insurance and governmental support, planning and preparation, expertise and labor, and available equipment and technologies are the most important institutional criteria. Communication and collective identity, mutual support, public safety and protection, public awareness, and social justice are the influential social criteria. Economic sustainability and resource availability are criteria of economic resilience. Sufficiency of services, public spaces, housing tenure, and transportation system are the main criteria related to the built environment and infrastructural dimension. Finally, demographic resilience includes physical health, psychological well-being, life quality, and hygiene. Based on these criteria, this study develops an integrated evaluation framework that researchers can implement along with conventional assessment and ranking methods to determine the level of community resilience to pandemics.",2022

At the same time, initiatives of city regeneration envision alternative forms of the urban environment, where derelict spaces have the potential to be brought back to life in ways that would not compromise urban health. Regeneration processes should utilise mitigation and adaptation strategies that consider the future needs and anticipated role of cities within the context of the discourse about climate change, accounting for expected and unforeseen impacts and regarding the city as an agent of action rather than a static territory, too complex to change. Nevertheless, literature implicating these three parameters synchronously, namely, climate change, cities, and health, has been scarce. This study aims to fill this gap through a systematic literature review, exploring climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies that can be employed in urban regeneration efforts seeking to mitigate climate-exacerbated phenomena and their impacts on urban health as well as identifying the main trends and opportunities overlooked. Findings show that even though the emphasis is given to the physical actions and impacts of climate change and urban health, an emerging theme is a need to engage civic society in co-designing urban spaces. Synergistic relationships, collaborations and avoidance of lock-in situations appear to be the most significant subtopics emerging from this literature review.

Climate emergencies caused by natural or anthropogenic activities have tragically consequential repercussions on agricultural output worldwide. Modern cropping systems profoundly rely on synthetic fertilizers to deliver necessary nutrients, yet their prolonged and persistent administration is hazardous to the environment, soil fertility, and nutritional dynamics of the rhizospheric microbiome. By addressing the drawback of physico-chemically synthesized nano-dimensioned fertilizer, this review emphasizes on integrating nanoparticles and biofertilizers conjointly as nano-biofertilizers (NBF) which can safeguard global food security, in light of the population surge. Inoculation with nanoparticles and biofertilizers strengthens plant growth and stress tolerance. However, combined together (NBF), they have emerged as a more economically and environmentally sustainable, highly versatile, and long-lasting agriculture tool. Microbe-based green synthesis using the encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles of Si, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ti, and Ag as well as organic materials, including chitosan, cellulose, and starch, to formulate NBFs can eliminate the constraints of conventional fertilizer contamination. The application of NBFs is in its infancy in agriculture, yet it has promising potential for transforming traditional farming techniques into smart agriculture, compared to any of the existing strategies. From this perspective, this review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formulations, fabrication, and characterization of NBFs while unraveling the underlying mechanisms of plant-NBF interactions along with their contribution to climate change-induced biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. We substantially summarize the latest advancements of field applications of NBFs for precision farming. Moreover, we critically revised their applications in agro-ecosystems according to the current literature, while also discussing the bottlenecks and future trends for developing potent NBFs.",2023

How to achieve green low-carbon operation of the gas extraction technology system is one of the key tasks for the sustainable development of the coal industry. Based on the characteristics of China's coal-based energy endowment and the difficulty of large-scale application of carbon-negative technologies, we took coal mine methane extraction technology as the entry point for our research. With the objectives of technological innovation and equipment upgrading, we have conducted an in-depth study of the key aspects of coal mine methane emission reduction that should be developed in a coordinated manner during the carbon peak and carbon neutrality stages, and the development pathway of AGE under the dual-carbon background was constructed. The sustainable development characteristics of “low-carbonization of the extraction system(L)-accurate drilling construction(A)-intellectualization of equipment development(I)-dynamic regulation of whole process(D)” was proposed at the carbon peak stage, ultimately achieving zero emission from CH4 extraction-low emissions of CO2. At the carbon neutrality stage, the overall planning of the whole industry chain of methane emission reduction should be emphasized, and the means of source management should be continuously implemented. In order to construct a technically reliable-low cost-long term safe carbon emission reduction technology system and ultimately hasten the accomplishment of China's “dual-carbon” strategic goal, full-concentration gas gradient utilization, “CCUS + ecological carbon sink” and other carbon negative technologies will be further strengthened.

One of the most significant shifts that defines Industry 5.0 is the change in focus from technology-driven progress to a genuinely human-centric approach. This means that the industrial sector should prioritize human needs and interests at the core of the production process. Instead of replacing workers on the shop floor, technologies should enhance their capabilities, leading to a safer and more fulfilling work environment. Consequently, the role of industrial operators is undergoing a substantial transformation. This subject has garnered increasing interest from both researchers and industries. However, there is a lack of comprehensive literature covering the concept of Operator 4.0.

The blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of reliable digital records that are shared by the participating networks. AI, on the other hand, and its applications have been used for developing futuristic machines that are capable of having human-like intelligence. The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues. The use of blockchain and AI technologies has the potential to fill the technology gaps in transportation systems and effectively address the existing challenges. The convergence of both technologies is likely to yield significant advantages and provide a common distributed platform for data sharing, reliability, and decision-making. The present study is focused on understanding both technologies and their convergence in various industrial domains with a specific emphasis on transportation systems. A detailed state-of-the-art review of the relevant literature is performed to identify the main advantages and challenges in the applications of blockchain and AI in transportation systems and other related domains along with the ways to overcome these challenges.

Meanwhile, adopting modern means of production using digital innovations can boost farmers' efficiency. Given the relevance of digital innovations within the agribusiness industry, the current paper gives an overview of digital innovations in the agribusiness industry, particularly in Africa, by synthesising existing literature on digital innovations to consolidate scattered ideas and give recommendations for practice and future studies. The PRISMA technique was adopted to synthesise 47 existing relevant articles from the Scopus database. Bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer and R-Package-Bibliometrix were used to analyse the data. From the results, most papers on African digital innovations emanated from a journal with a broader scope—Sustainability Journal (Switzerland). Most of the funding for digital innovation studies in agribusiness was sponsored by foreign donors outside the African Continent, with the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers in France sponsoring the most research. Based on the publication synthesis and the trend of publications, five themes, namely, digital innovations in the agricultural value chain, training and skills development through digital innovations, digital finance innovations in agribusiness, precision digital innovations: agribusiness survival, and drivers of digital innovation adoption in agribusiness were identified. From the results, digital agribusiness innovations in marketing, production, and finance have been profound in Africa, though they are skewed towards a few South, West, and North African countries. Meanwhile, the drivers and challenges of digital innovations in Africa have been mainly social, economic, political, and institutional factors. Given the results, it is recommended that, since most of the studies were primarily sponsored by foreign governments, thus betraying the commitment of the African continent's readiness to transform the agribusiness sector via innovation and technology, African Governments, first, and second, non-governmental organisations and other agricultural donors should prioritise the digitalisation of the agriculture sector by integrating them into economic development plans and making relevant resources available to all actors from upstream to downstream.",2024

Cardiac telerehabilitation has demonstrated effectiveness for patient health outcomes, but uptake and implementation into practice have been limited and variable. While patient-level influences on uptake have been identified, little is known about provider- and system-level factors.
Aims
To identify provider and system barriers and enablers to uptake and implementation of cardiac telerehabilitation.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted, including a search of six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) from 2000 to March 2023. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles. Study quality was evaluated according to study design by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative data, the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies (AXIS), and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for mixed methods. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis.
Results
Twenty eligible studies (total 1674 participants) were included. Perceived provider-level barriers included that cardiac telerehabilitation is resource intensive, inferior to centre-based delivery, and lack of staff preparation. Whereas provider-level enablers were having access to resources, adequate staff preparation, positive staff beliefs regarding cardiac telerehabilitation and positive team dynamics. System-level barriers related to unaligned policy, healthcare system and insurance structures, technology issues, lack of plans for implementation, and inadequate resources. System-level enablers included cost-effectiveness, technology availability, reliability, and adaptability, and adequate program development, implementation planning and leadership support.
Conclusions
Barriers and enablers at both provider and system levels must be recognised and addressed at the local context to ensure better uptake of cardiac telerehabilitation programs.",2024

We identified various management themes and the extent these themes are related to economic, social and environmental sustainability goals using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and text mining. Six sustainability management themes were identified. The analysis shows that overall, the sustainability management themes appear to be socio-economic in nature based on the relative occurrences of indicators belonging to the three sustainability goals. When comparing the strength of the three sustainability goals in each management theme, the social goal appears to be most prominent in four management themes, the economic goal in one theme, and a balance of the three sustainability goals in another theme. Furthermore, this study shows which fishery management themes are most (dis-)similar based on clustering. Policy makers and other fishery management bodies can use these insights to optimize the sustainability goals in fisheries by not only relying on a single management theme in each fishery, by improving focus on large scale fishers, by incorporating underexplored sustainability indicators, and by adapting current trends and proven-to-be effective management themes.",2022

There is an ongoing digital revolution in the field of Parkinson's disease (PD) for the objective measurement of motor aspects, to be used in clinical trials and possibly support therapeutic choices. The focus of remote technologies is now also slowly shifting towards the broad but more “hidden” spectrum of non-motor symptoms (NMS).
Methods
A narrative review of digital health technologies for measuring NMS in people with PD was conducted. These digital technologies were defined as assessment tools for NMS offered remotely in the form of a wearable, downloadable as a mobile app, or any other objective measurement of NMS in PD that did not require a hospital visit and could be performed remotely. Searches were performed using peer-reviewed literature indexed databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials), as well as Google and Google Scholar.
Results
Eighteen studies deploying digital health technology in PD were identified, for example for the measurement of sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension. In addition, we describe promising developments in other conditions that could be translated for use in PD.
Conclusion
Unlike motor symptoms, non-motor features of PD are difficult to measure directly using remote digital technologies. Nonetheless, it is currently possible to reliably measure several NMS and further digital technology developments are underway to offer further capture of often under-reported and under-recognised NMS.",2021

Effective use of telehealth offers substantial benefits to older persons and aged care providers. However, data privacy concerns challenge the effective use of telehealth and subsequent business value. Through developing a theoretical model, we explain how privacy concerns can influence the adoption ad use of telehealth in this complex context.
Method
An integrative review of empirical investigations was conducted by linking privacy concerns, telehealth use, and aged care. We searched three major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) for articles published until December 2020. Articles were analyzed and presented using an integrative theoretical model that we labeled CPCPO (Context-Privacy Concerns-Practice-Outcomes).
Results
Our review revealed that privacy concerns are a contextual concept, i.e., different contexts (users, telehealth systems, aged care services, data) produce different privacy concerns. We found that privacy concerns were more voiced in home telecare and were associated with the degree of telemonitoring and surveillance. Contextual privacy concerns were related to video recording, behavioral data (e.g., sleep patterns and eating behavior), location data, and future use of data. These concerns can influence the adoption and use of telehealth. However, privacy protection practices (e.g., informed consent) can help in reducing the concerns and improving the acceptance of telehealth for older persons.
Conclusion
CPCPO offers contextual explanations of telehealth privacy concerns and systems use. For improving telehealth acceptance, privacy concerns of data processing (e.g., recording, collection, storage, and secondary use) must be addressed by performing data protection practices. Based on the review results, we suggest avenues for future research.",2022

The study adhered to the PICOC guidelines (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context) to structure the review. A literature search across six databases led to the analysis of thirty-one primary studies. These studies were selected using the StArt tool, based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among these criteria, a quality assessment was highlighted, evaluating four aspects: the alignment of the primary studies with the review and three aspects related to bibliometric data, including the publication venue and the number of citations. The results reveal that the concept of sustainable energy differs from renewable energy and is divided into two categories: renewable sources and functionalities. This study proposes five dimensions to categorize the constructs: environmental, technical, economic, social, and institutional.

Yet, technoscience is offering new tools that have the potential to reimagine how inland fisheries are assessed and managed. So-called “technoscience” refers to instances in which science and technology unfurl together, offering novel ways of spurring and achieving meaningful change. This paper considers the role of technoscience and its potential for modernizing the assessment and management of inland fisheries. It first explores technoscience and its potential benefits, followed by presentation of a series of synopses that explore the application (both successes and challenges) of new technologies such as environmental DNA (eDNA), genomics, electronic tags, drones, phone apps, iEcology, and artificial intelligence to assessment and management. The paper also considers the challenges and barriers that exist in adopting new technologies. The paper concludes with a provocative assessment of the potential of technoscience to reform and modernize inland fisheries assessment and management. Although these tools are increasingly being embraced, there is a lack of platforms for aggregating these data streams and providing managers with actionable information in a timely manner. The ideas presented here should serve as a catalyst for beginning to work collectively and collaboratively towards fisheries assessment and management systems that harness the power of technology and serve to modernize inland fisheries management. Such transformation is urgently needed given the dynamic nature of environmental change, the evolving threat matrix facing inland waters, and the complex behavior of fishers.

Co-production of knowledge has become a key, intrinsic component in both sustainability sciences and adaptation research. In this review article, we investigate if and how the SDG agenda is included in the application of participatory approaches and co-production of knowledge for climate change adaptation. We review findings from such processes in projects whose objective is to foster adaptation in the context of SDGs and to categorize the methods employed to forward co-production. We investigate 1) whether and how co-production approaches localize SDG targets and address tradeoffs and synergies, 2) whether they focus on power asymmetries and political dimensions in such participatory processes, and 3) whether and how the literature show that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift in the role of researchers towards a more interventionist approach to co-production. Our results show that there is little evidence that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift towards more interventionist or transformative approaches within climate change adaptation. Further, we have a identified a missed opportunity in the exclusion of “social” SDGs (SDG 5 and 10) in the discussions of adaptation and co-production and SGDs. Most importantly, we find that participatory efforts, including the co-production of knowledge, for localizing SDG goals and resolving tradeoffs and benefits, are the most salient aspects that tie the three co-production - adaptation - the SDG agenda together. Such participatory localizing processes have a great potential in facilitating long-enduring empowerment and legitimacy in adaptation efforts.",2022

The current trend is to use blockchain to secure key management operations in Named Data Networking. This survey aimed to identify key management challenges in Named Data Networking and how they were mitigated using blockchain. For this purpose, the survey comprehensively reviewed the existing blockchain-based key management systems for Named Data Networking. It summarized how these systems solve different key management problems using blockchain. It also performed a comparative analysis of these systems based on three references. Firstly, the systems were analyzed to investigate their conformance to the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommendations for secure key management. Secondly, the systems were examined concerning the Named Data Networking platform to reveal information about their key namespace and key object structure. Thirdly, the systems were analyzed based on the blockchain platform and compared regarding their functionality, performance, and security. The content stored in the blockchain was also examined to uncover the relationship between the key, key name, and blockchain. The survey concluded by identifying research gaps and opportunities for further research. This paper contributed to gaining knowledge about key management security challenges faced by Named Data Networking. It revealed how blockchain technology addressed these key management security challenges. It also identified blockchain features that can be adopted to secure key management operations further. The survey results provided a template to guide future research to secure key management in NDN with blockchain.",2023

Even when discussed, narratives around droughts emphasize implications on rural populations and there remain empirical and conceptual gaps on drought impacts in urban areas. We focus on losses and damages associated with urban drought and water insecurity through a review of interventions and policies in seven Asian countries. We find evidence of urban droughts leading to tangible losses (e.g. groundwater over-extraction, economic impacts) and intangible losses (e.g. conflict, increased drudgery). We highlight examples of Asian cities minimizing urban drought-related losses and damages through nature-based, institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptation interventions. We argue that water management policies that take into account current and projected L&D of urban droughts as well as beyond-urban dynamics of water availability and sharing are essential for effective climate adaptation.",2021

Australia has identified bioproducts from a FLW feedstock as one avenue through which it can meet its commitment to UN Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3, aiming to halve food waste by 2030. An industry for bioproducts in Australia is, however, nascent and will require targeted and sustained policy intervention to advance in line with the production targets it has set to meet Target 12.3. The aim of this critical review is threefold. Firstly, it draws on the research literature to identify barriers to advancing a bioproduct industry from FLW. Secondly, it constructs a taxonomy of policies available to overcome these barriers and support industry development. Finally, it applies the taxonomy to established policy settings in Australia (examining both national settings and Queensland state settings) and the European Union (EU), where the industry and associated policy is more mature. Australia has few national policies directly targeting a bioproduct industry. A comparative assessment of policy settings allows this review to identify lessons Australia can draw from the EU experience as it advances its own industry. Findings demonstrate a complex and fragmented policy landscape. Key recommendations from the literature emphasise the need to establish coordinated strategic instruments; target research and development opportunities for optimised, sustainable processes; and implement appropriate incentives to establish a ‘level playing field’, as technology readiness increases. The critical requirement for policy stability and coherence, flags the need to lay groundwork policy in this area as a priority.",2024

As a result, there has been a proliferation of concepts in the scientific literature, such as community energy, energy communities, community solar, and community wind. However, what scholars mean by “community” in these contexts is often unclear and inconsistent. This paper provides further conceptual clarity in the field by analyzing how the term of community is conceptualized in the scholarly literature on energy systems, through a systematic review of 405 articles. We combine an author keyword network analysis of this corpus with an in-depth analysis of 183 definitions extracted from these articles and systematically coded across three dimensions: meanings, activities and objectives of communities. Our findings show that the meanings attached to the notion of community and the alleged objectives pursued by communities vary substantially across concepts and over time. In particular, there has been a shift away from a notion of community understood as a process that emphasizes participatory aspects toward a notion of community primarily referring to a place. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on communities' economic objectives rather than their social or political goals. These findings suggest a weakening of scholars’ attention to “transformative” notions of community emphasizing collective and grassroots processes of participation in energy transitions, to the benefit of “instrumental” notions. This trend runs the risk of placing the sole emphasis on the market value of communities, thereby diluting their distinctiveness from more commercial actors.",2022

Energy efficiency first emerged in the EU energy policy agenda in the 1970s and was progressively transformed with shifting global and EU energy and climate policies and priorities. The paper offers a review of EU energy policies spanning over the last half century with a focus on policy instruments to encourage measures on energy efficiency in new and existing buildings. Starting from early policies set by the EU in response to the Oil Embargo in the 1973, the paper discusses the impact of EU policies in stimulating energy efficiency improvements in the building sector ranging from the SAVE Directive to the recently 2018 updated Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and Energy Efficiency Directive. The review explores the progress made over the last 50 years in addressing energy efficiency in buildings and highlights successes as well as remaining challenges.

Since the contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and of agent-based models in particular, was instrumental in the evolution of CPPSs, approaches of ethical AI should be endorsed in CPPS development by design. The paper discusses recent advances for ethical AI and suggests a pathway from ethical norms towards standards. As it is argued, taking the responsible AI approach is promising when tackling the main ethic-related challenges of Cyber-Physical Production Systems.

The BBB concept is broadly focused on housing. BBB Critical Infrastructure (CI) has received less attention and is still considered an emerging topic. The accumulation of knowledge about the concept and how to guide its application is in relatively short supply. To this end, this review paper presents a broad and structured state-of-the-art of the BBB CI concept. Being one of a few studies in a rather underexplored area of research, the main aim is to accelerate the accumulation and assimilation of BBB CI knowledge into the existing body of knowledge and unlock research needs. Reviewing existing research revealed trends, conceptual definitions, implementation aspects, frameworks, significant gaps, unanswered questions and perspectives for future research, connecting both theory and practice of BBB CI. A key result showed that theoretical themes are highly controversial, translating into contextual constraints that hamper the application of BBB CI. Perspectives for research lines of work that could be potent elements to overcome these constraints and further drive forward BBB CI are presented.",2023

Additionally, manufacturing automation has led to mass production and consumption, triggering waste production. The existing linear economy approach has led to increasing waste production and resource depletion, posing significant environmental and public health threats. To overcome these impediments, an alternative model called the circular economy concept has gained popularity in the global industry community. This closed-loop, restorative, waste-free concept has the potential to protect the environment and improve economics by reducing energy and resource consumption. Thus, major impetus should be given to strengthening the backbone of the economy where tools such as green technologies, decarbonization strategies, bio refinery processes, material flow analysis, life cycle assessment, ecological footprints (water, carbon, and material), substance flow analysis, circularity index, eco-designing, bioresource management, new business models, and policy play an essential role in the areas of socio-economic sustainability, ecological facts, and industrial aspects to enhance socio-economic growth in a sustainable manner.

To scrutinize such participatory processes within the climate and energy fields, we conducted a critical systematic review of 183 records, which includes scientific publications, but also other initiatives coming from the public administration or the non-profit sector. First, we unpack six aspects of co-production: (1) the different levels of participation; (2) the emerging topics and issues; (3) the scale and location at which initiatives are conducted; (4) the actors who take part in the processes; (5) the different methods and tools for participation and (6) the outcomes and transformational potential of the initiatives. Our results show that real co-production is still far from being mainstream, with consultation still accounting for a majority of initiatives. Themes remain focused on the mitigation sphere, a tendency related to a majority of the records happening in developed countries. However, we also observe new categories of actors challenging traditional decision-making, as well as emerging methods and tools opening the space for more social innovation and participation. Following, in our critical analysis, we argue that there is a crucial need for a better interconnection between science and policy (especially at national and international scales) and that a reflection on transformation is fundamental when planning any participatory initiative. We finally claim that, despite not being a silver bullet, meaningful citizen participation constitutes a viable alternative to tackle today's complex problems.",2021

The reliability of these assessments is critical for achieving future energy targets. However, there is evidence of a significant Energy Performance Gap (EPG) in buildings, defined as the difference between measured and calculated energy consumption. This work performs a systematic review of EPG causes and reduction strategies in the context of heating of residential buildings. It introduces the concept of “optimal” consumption, in contrast to “theoretical” (i.e. calculated with standards) and “actual” (i.e. measured) consumption, which enables a more rigorous classification of causes and potential solutions to the EPG. This review found that inaccuracies in modelling of building characteristics and occupant behaviour has been most studied by researchers. It found that many EPG reduction strategies have been proposed, which can be categorized into two groups. The first aims to improve the energy consumption calculation by correcting the standard assumptions and/or considering new approaches to create energy certificates. The second group focuses on improving the actual performance of the building’s energy systems, through better monitoring, maintenance, and general usage of the building. A range of practical strategies were identified, which are relevant to a range of stakeholder groups. At the same time, this work also highlights that understanding of the relative importance of EPG causes and the potential impact of the corresponding solutions is incomplete.",2021

Data-driven digital health technologies have the power to transform health care. If these tools could be sustainably delivered at scale, they might have the potential to provide everyone, everywhere, with equitable access to expert-level care, narrowing the global health and wellbeing gap. Conversely, it is highly possible that these transformative technologies could exacerbate existing health-care inequalities instead. In this Viewpoint, we describe the problem of health data poverty: the inability for individuals, groups, or populations to benefit from a discovery or innovation due to a scarcity of data that are adequately representative. We assert that health data poverty is a threat to global health that could prevent the benefits of data-driven digital health technologies from being more widely realised and might even lead to them causing harm. We argue that the time to act is now to avoid creating a digital health divide that exacerbates existing health-care inequalities and to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era.",2021

A Conceptual Framework,"Low carbon transition, Energy retrofit, Knowledge exchange, Literature review, Conceptual framework","This study explores the role of Energy Retrofit (ER) in Low Carbon Transition (LCT). The literature recognises the need to move towards a transdisciplinary approach in ER, which encompasses multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. However, the fragmentation between different disciplines remains a significant problem, mainly due to challenges associated with knowledge exchange across the allied disciplines that play a role in ER. The authors posit that ER projects has been conceptualised and implemented using a Systems perspective so that an integrated approach that is akin to transdisciplinarity could become commonplace. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to establish to what extent ER has been conceptualised as a System in the literature so that complexities can effectively be managed through a transdisciplinary approach. This work is based on a literature review of 136 peer-reviewed journal papers. The content analysis demonstrates that current research on transdisciplinarity in ER can be conceptualised in five categories and 15 lines of research. They are presented as a Conceptual Framework, which is this paper’s main contribution to existing knowledge. It reveals the direction of innovation in ER for LCT, and is illustrated as a cognitive map. This map exposes the current fragmentation implicit in the literature, and proposes critical connections that need to be established for a transdisciplinary approach. It also shows that the discourse on LCT changed by moving beyond the building scale; and recognising the need to embrace disruptive and local technologies, and integrating the social and technical aspects of ER. Innovative technical solutions and robust information modelling approaches emerge as key vehicles towards making decisions that pay regard to the economic, social and technical factors and that empower the prosumers to play an active role in LCT.",2020

Given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase of energy demand, in addition to investments in energy efficiency technologies, there is the need for a change of energy end-users behaviour and life style to obtain additional energy savings by limiting the demand for services. Traditionally, energy efficiency policies have mainly targeted and promoted energy efficient technologies (e.g., energy performance standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, financial incentives for new technologies, etc.). In some cases, the energy savings achieved have been less than expected, due to a rebound effect, or because external factors (e.g., growth in populations or economies) have increased energy consumption. The “traditional” energy efficiency policies are still very necessary, but are not sufficient for reaching the Paris Agreement target and the rapid reduction of the energy demand. Policies focusing on energy conservation and sufficiency principles complement efficiency policies, in particular those aiming at changing end-user consumer behaviour and lifestyle by imposing some limitation to the demand for energy services. The article first reviews the concept of energy savings compared to energy efficiency and introduce the concept of energy sufficiency. Then the article explores and discusses some existing and new policy instruments that can address energy conservation and sufficiency such as: personal carbon allowances; energy/carbon taxation; progressive appliance and vehicles standards, and progressive building codes. The article’s focus is mainly on individual end-users and on residential buildings. Finally, the article provides an ex-ante assessment of the policies analysed, including their limitations, and offers some policy recommendations, based on a combination of instruments.",2022

It is vital for its social, economic, cultural, and ecological benefits, demanding in-depth research for sustainable development. Despite its potential contribution to sustainable development, previous studies on bamboo have been geographically and methodically limited, lacking a comprehensive analysis of its contribution to sustainable livelihoods. This study, employing the PRISMA method for systematic reviews of 127 articles, investigates (1) the distribution and trends of livelihood-based bamboo research and identifies knowledge gaps, (2) bamboo's role in livelihood enhancement, (3) challenges and opportunities in its livelihood values, and (4) strategies to optimize bamboo's livelihood potential. Through this review, we identified most of the research limited to Asia, with limited studies in Africa and Latin America. Out of 1600 species, most of the studies focus on only 83 bamboo species, noting their multifaceted contributions across all livelihood capital types: natural, human, physical, social, and financial. Despite administrative and technical challenges that limit its value, bamboo provides diverse tangible benefits, economic opportunities, environmental improvements, international appeal, and strong sociocultural ties. We advocate for resilient bamboo-based livelihoods through cooperative, participatory, and sustainable management approaches that integrate research and indigenous knowledge to navigate challenges and leverage bamboo's extensive benefits.",2024

Synthesizing the relevant literature, this paper provides a critical reflection on the transition to a CE in China. Key factors for China's success in shifting towards a CE are seen in multi-level indicators and upscaling niches. This paper makes a novel contribution on limitations to progress, based on emerging evidence on CE projects that fail to sustain. Enriched by experts feedback, this paper critically addresses future challenges to a deep transition resulting from implementation gaps between early majorities and mass markets and coordination challenges arising through regional and sectoral differences. In light of China's commitments to climate neutrality by 2060, such challenges are considered serious. Based on feasible policy learning, the paper however proposes synergies between the CE and decarbonisation driven by efficiency improvements, comprehensive core indicators, upscaling and urban policies as trigger for deeper transformations. Finally the paper undertakes broader reflections and an outlook on evidence-orientated policy learning for a CE and decarbonisation in China.",2022

Unpredictable precipitation patterns and droughts are contributing to declining crop productivity. Efforts to increase agricultural productivity include adoption of crops that are resistant to climate change and engaging in climate resilient agriculture. Currently, CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - associated protein) technology is being used in crop breeding practices to improve traits such as drought tolerance, nutrition and disease resistance. The aim of this review is to explore the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in developing climate resilient crops for mitigation of food insecurity and hunger and the attendant implications for small holder farmers in Africa. A comprehensive systematic search of peer reviewed articles in three bibliographic databases, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify documents relevant to applications and implications of CRISPR-mediated genome editing in crop improvement in the African context. The literature shows that CRISPR-Cas technology has been harnessed to enhance the resilience and nutritional content of various crops, by combatting biotic and abiotic stresses. The adoption of CRISPR-assisted crop improvement in breeding strategies can help smallholder farmers in low-middle income countries of Africa to adapt to climate change without productivity loss. By harnessing this technology, smallholder farmers can benefit from growing climate resilient crops with improved yields and stress resistance thereby contributing to food security and sustainable agriculture on the continent.",2024

In India, recent urban pluvial floods have affected population displacement, damaged infrastructure, and impacted means of livelihood. In this paper, we describe the current state of rainfall-driven flood research in India, focusing on how the scholarly community approaches the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies in urban settings. This systematic literature review of academic databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar asks: 1) In the context of India, how do we define urban pluvial flooding? 2) What factors cause urban pluvial flooding in India? 3) What are the impacts of urban pluvial flooding in India? and 4) What mitigation strategies should be adopted to cope with urban pluvial floods?

They have opened the horizon for a vast array of applications and paved the way for a diversity of innovative solutions. Integrating drones with the Internet has led to the emergence of a new paradigm named the Internet of Drones (IoD). Several works dealt with the security of the IoD, and various surveys have been published on this topic over the past few years. The existing surveys either have limited scope or offer partial coverage of cybersecurity countermeasures. To address these gaps, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey related to the cyber and physical security of IoD. Differently from many surveys that only provide a classification of attacks/threats, we also propose three taxonomies that are related to (1) the assets of drones, (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures. The first taxonomy is a two-level classification of the assets in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to the IoD's tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. Based on the asset classification, we propose a taxonomy of attacks targeting the coarse and fine-grained assets, which allows a finer level of granularity to identify threats, and thus ensure better security. Also, we evaluate the risk of cyber and physical attacks by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of Impact, which connects four types of impacts, namely, Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment. We propose a taxonomy of technical and non-technical countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident, and Post-incident (or recovery). The pre-incident countermeasures are further classified as: preventive and detective. In addition, we present the countermeasures along with their performance and limitations. Finally, open research challenges are identified and ranked according to the level of attention they should receive from the research community. Also, future research directions and suggestions are presented for the security of the IoD.",2023

In fact, in most cases, users are not aware that their information is being gathered, nor can they properly control these data flows. Nowadays, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation calls for the adoption of transparent practices comprising, inter alia, adequate notification mechanisms, proper consent management schemes, and the development of models to empower the user as an active participant, with full control over the data flows, along with privacy preservation techniques. In this specific context, the aim of this manuscript is to present a review of existing user-centric privacy preservation models.

In this article, we explore the state of FEW nexus research in Guatemala to highlight progress while also pointing out future research needs. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published on this topic from January 2000 to May 2020. Articles were reviewed and classified to identify the Guatemalan study location, type, topic, and data sources. Only a limited number of studies explored the interconnectedness of FEW systems; 26% of articles (36 out of 138) focused on two aspects of the FEW nexus, while 20% (27 out of 138) focused on all three aspects. Water issues were the most commonly studied, with drinking water, hydroelectricity, and wastewater management being frequently discussed. We also identified a low rate of primary data generation, with only 42% articles (58 of 138) generating new data, and greater emphasis of nexus research in the grey literature. The Guatemalan FEW connections revolve primarily around three separate yet related spheres: clean water and sanitation, climate change and renewable energy, and urbanization and modernization. Further expanding initiatives that simultaneously address these three spheres would yield improved understanding of the interconnected roles that food, energy, and water play in improving the resiliency of natural resources and reducing multidimensional poverty in Guatemala.",2021

This study adopts the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and their sustainable targets as means to assess the intensity of the link between the PPP literature and sustainability. Findings show that the thematic keywords in the PPP literature are multidimensionally related to sustainability through 16 out of the 17 SDGs. However, the intensity of this relationship is heterogenous: while eleven SDGs were related to less than 5% of the topics, only four SDGs (i.e., 8, 9, 16, and 17) demonstrated a strong relationship with PPPs, representing 51 out of the 169 sustainability targets. Moreover, 19 sustainability targets within these four SDGs were found to be the most representative according to their connection with the studied PPP topics, underlining high interdependencies between the PPP field and the three sustainability dimensions (society, environment, and economy). Overall, this study establishes a foundation for future studies on sustainability in PPPs by proposing three research avenues associated with social, environmental, and economic perspectives: (1) exposing the life-cycle relations between sources of payment, financing conditions, and costs of PPPs. (2) examining the most relevant challenges in achieving social legitimacy of PPP programs in developing countries.

Because the demand-side management can be a great ally in overcoming such challenges, the present study seeks to assist in these new challenges by conducting a literature review, accompanied by a critical analysis of Brazilian experiences with demand-side management actions such as daylight saving time, energy efficiency programs, time-of-use tariffs, distributed micro and mini generation, tariff flags, pilot demand response programs, voluntary demand reduction programs, structural demand response programs, and hourly electricity prices. In addition, the current regulatory framework of the Brazilian electricity sector in the context of the energy transition is presented and discussed. The results of this study clearly indicate that Brazil has made important and necessary recent advances in updating its regulatory framework in line with the energy transition process. Undoubtedly, such efforts will elevate demand-side management to an increasingly strategic level in the planning and operation of the country's electrical networks. However, it was found that route corrections must be made aimed at the adequate integration of distributed energy resources, especially regarding the need to improve the tariff schemes applied to the low-voltage consumers.

The operator is in the middle of this complexity, trying to understand the situation and make effective real-time decisions. Hence, human factors, especially cognitive ones, are a major issue to be addressed. The human cognitive part must be framed together with intelligent artefacts, requiring a systematic approach in the domain of joint cognitive systems. New software development methods in the form of assistants and wizards are necessary to help operators to be context-aware and reduce their technical workload regarding coding or computer-oriented skills, focusing on the task or service at hand. Building on previous research on the role of the human worker in an AIoT environment, this article analyses the described situation in terms of human cyber–physical systems, with the aim of proposing a conceptual framework for these assistance systems at the cognitive level.

The sustainability of airport operations is being raised in various international platforms. This paper aims to identify the dimensions of sustainability and evaluate sustainable practices in airports of selected ASEAN countries. The various dimensions associated with the environmental aspect are energy management, emissions management, water and effluents management, solid waste management. It was understood that noise management, employee development, and community investment belong to the social dimension. Similarly, the factors such as economic contribution, passenger experience, airport safety, and security are inclined to economic dimensions of sustainability. It was found that environmentally sustainable practices have greater importance than social and economic initiatives in the airport context which provide quantifiable benefits for airports in the long term. Airport operators in South East Asia strived to mitigate carbon emissions, reduce waste and effluents, enhance the economic contribution, satisfy passengers, and meet employee needs. Compared to the total economic and social benefits obtained from these airports, the negative impacts of airport operation (such as noise emission from aircraft) are minimal but significant. The most common sustainable initiatives in airports, such as employee development, energy management, and passenger safety, supported sustainable development goals (SDG) 8, SDG 9, and SDG 11. A weak connection is observed between SDG 14 & SDG 15 and the airport's sustainable practices. The new technological innovations are concentrated in busy and profitable airports. A slow trend towards the adoption of new technologies for sustainable practices is observed in airports. The paper concludes that major airport operators in South-East Asia have effectively responded to the growing sustainability challenges in aviation markets.

EPs are different from dark patterns, which are intentionally deceptive practices. We articulate the concept of EPs by demarcating it from dark patterns and highlighting the challenges arising from uncertainties around pitfalls. We situate and operationalize the concept using a case study that showcases how, despite best intentions, unsuspecting negative effects, such as unwarranted trust in numerical explanations, can emerge. We propose proactive and preventative strategies to address EPs at three interconnected levels: research, design, and organizational.

The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol addresses some of the challenges of managing GHG emissions associated with refrigerant gases – aiming for countries to reduce them by 85% by 2047 (from a 2019 baseline for developed countries). This paper presents the first holistic framework for transitioning cooling towards circularity, with an emphasis on the global production network of cooling. It serves to analyse active technologies (including but not limited to air conditioners) to inform such a transition. This circular cooling production network framework is based on an extensive and systematic literature review including text-mining algorithms to analyse word correlations and detect topics. The application of the framework reveals the long-term interactions between cooling macro-drivers and the various stages of the cooling lifecycle. For example, currently the energy used by cooling technologies dominates their carbon footprint reporting but shifting to cleaner energy supply solutions will make components' production and end-of-life stages more important for circularity. Working proactively to address, and not only some, but all stages of the production network is thereby critical. Three cooling energy-intensive cases are used to describe the analysis: cold chains, commercial refrigeration, and air conditioning in buildings. Specific intervention points are examined for each which can improve the circularity of the production network, for instance, using passive measures to reduce the need for active cooling, recycling appliances, and raising awareness to improve users' behaviour. As the expanding global requirements of cooling unfold, this paper lays forth pathways to influence its growth as a system in alignment with achieving a circular economy.",2022

Their light-to-color conversion is highly dependent on the electronic band structure and charge transfer, and they obey the mechanism of electron accumulation in semiconductors when excited within the bandgap. Pure semiconductors face limitations in practical applications due to insufficient light absorption, charge carrier recombination, and low charge capacity. Diverse forms of photochromic hybrids (nanopowders, films, hydrogels, and multilayer structures) with rapid change, repeatability, and reversibility are possible via nanocustomization, surface/interface engineering, heterojunction fabrication, and complexing organic ligands. Manipulating the function of photochromic systems through light stimulation is becoming an attractive paradigm, divided into two branches: light-color complementarity and photoconductivity. This review examines the widely accepted photoresponsive principles and the still controversial energy transfer models.

To explore these issues in depth, we show how they arise frequently in UK energy policy research and its impact on policymaking. First, our systematic review shows how researchers present patchy or inconsistent stories, in which the role of policy and policymaking is unclear, when they describe energy systems.

With child labor in cocoa production, health issues of plantation workers in the global south and unsustainable consumption patterns of consumers in the global north, trade arrangements in the global food sector remain on largely unsustainable pathways with vast consequences for a sustainable development. Alternative Trade arrangements have been proposed as one way to tackle the above-mentioned issues and have been increasingly investigated through the scientific literature. However, evidence about the impact of alternative trade arrangements on consumption in the global north or production in the global south is disputed. While there have been efforts to review the scientific literature, existing reviews have focused only on specific aspects (e.g. consumer perception or effectiveness of producer certification schemes). We therefore systematically reviewed 649 peer-reviewed publications that investigated food products and alternative trade arrangements to create a more comprehensive overview of the strand of literature, its epistemic similarities and differences. We found that the scientific literature is predominantly investigating the certified market, focusing on certification schemes and its implementations. Furthermore, we show that the literature is either focusing on producers or consumers and has a strong bias towards social aspects of sustainability. Using a quantitative word-based analysis, we identified three substantially different clusters: first, producer impact assessment, dominated by econometrics; second, contextual producer perspectives, emphasizing the political and social sphere through qualitative single case study analyses; and third consumers' attitudes and willingness to pay for ethical products, characterized by psychological and econometric measures. Based on our findings we propose three future directions for research in the field of alternative trade. First, scholars should put a stronger emphasis on going beyond the impact assessment of certification schemes and examine underlying aspects such as information asymmetries, smallholder empowerment and ethical consumption behavior. Second, interconnections between social and ecological factors needs further investigation as both factors have a strong influence on each other. Third, scholars should put a stronger focus on participatory approaches to gain a deeper understanding of root causes of unjust trade arrangements and enhance mutual understanding of scientific perceptions and realworld practices.",2020

Background and aims
Artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded applications in both medicine and biomedical sciences, focusing on medical diagnosis, risk prediction of disease onset, support of therapeutic techniques, and other subjects. In parallel, several applications in nutrition have been developed, such as microbiota/genes-diet interactions, investigation of diet-disease relationships, chatbots for lifestyle intervention, dietary assessment with food photographs, and food composition applications.
Methods
The positive aspects and ethical concerns were analyzed regarding the use of AI in nutrition.
Results
In general, AI should do no harm and contribute to human well-being, while AI professionals should be honest, trustful, and fair. Privacy and confidentiality should be protected. Other concerns include the “dehumanization” of care, social disparities, responsibility assignment in case of errors or malfunctions, and bias in training models and delivering care. Moreover, the prediction of disease onset in high-risk individuals may be connected to stigma, over-medicalization, and stress. There is also a serious concern that AI systems in the field of nutrition and dietetics may cause a partial replacement of dietitians; however, health professionals can use such technologies as part of their work. The use of AI applications for persons with mental diseases or eating disorders is also crucial.
Conclusion
In conclusion, AI-assisted personalized nutrition needs further justification, while the regulatory framework requires a constant update to keep up with scientific advancements and address ethical issues. Coordinated global focus on these domains could effectively lead to a more embraced AI implementation in individuals and populations.",2023

It encompasses various concepts and methods, deployed by researchers in many diverse fields of computation and cognition. This is the computational mode of a brain, based on artificial neural networks. The usefulness of AI ethically, initiates a big question i.e. if the human mind is not self-sufficient for any work without harming the moral sentiment of others then, how can people believe in a computational model of the mind, is a machine, morally responsible for any good or bad action. We highlight issues on the use of AI in the replacement of the human mind asking what is the value of humans in this age of AI? Can AI reciprocate and respect human values better than human beings? Can AI replace human intelligence? In the case of ethical enquiry, it is rather a herculean task to consider a machine's action to be moral or immoral, after all, it is just a machinery action devoid of any moral quality.",2023

Energy systems integration connecting the power, gas, heat and transport systems, is one possible pathway to drive the transition flexibly and cost-effectively. Nevertheless, more quantified evidence on the performance of future integrated energy systems towards achieving policy objectives is still needed for decision makers to support this route. This paper first identifies the expected changes to the energy system upon integration, including new interactions and interdependencies between its components and actors. The paper then argues the need for a whole energy systems approach for the evaluation of integrated energy systems, represented by six characteristics: multidimensional, multivectoral, systemic, futuristic, systematic, and applicability. Based on the identified characteristics, the paper reviews existing evaluation frameworks for energy systems sustainability, and qualitatively appraises their adequacy for evaluating future integrated energy systems. The review concludes that existing frameworks are not capable of assessing the performance of integrated energy systems, lacking one or more of the characteristics. The paper finally presents a novel holistic evaluation framework based on the System-of-Systems approach for systems analysis coupled with an indicator-based approach for evaluation. The proposed framework demonstrates the six characteristics as it enables evaluation with respect to multiple perspectives and objectives at different system levels. Moreover, this framework captures future changes to the whole energy system architecture and highlights the interdependencies between energy systems.

The case for suboptimal systems,"Resilience, biosphere, technosphere, digital transformation, optimization, complex systems, feedback, human interactions","Human societies rely on rules to function, curbing the interests of individuals in favor of the interests of the population. A review of recent progress in biology and digital sciences suggests that such strategies might be universal: many living and technological systems favor the interests of the population to the detriment of individuals, at all scales. They behave in a suboptimal manner, restraining short-term performances while ensuring a high level of global resilience. This paper describes the features of such suboptimal systems. By synthesizing numerous examples within biological, and socio-cultural systems, we show how suboptimality might constitute a powerful source of inspiration to address the numerous trade-offs humanity is facing in the anthropocene. Should human societies curb their performance for the now anthropic ecosystems to be resilient? New research themes, such as soft law, agroecology, and planetary health, already echo suboptimal behaviors. These examples suggest that a better knowledge of suboptimal systems could help formalize a rational limit to human development towards sustainability, very much like the planetary boundaries for their Earth counterpart. Conversely, this synthesis also raises a question of whether human societies could be resilient without being suboptimal?",2020

The COVID-19 outbreak has profound ramifications for multiple dimensions of landscapes, ranging from mobility and lifestyle to value to environment and society. Therefore, integrated approaches to “health” have been more vigorously promoted in the policy arena dealing with human–nature interactions. The ecosystem principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which resonate with landscape approaches, are generally aligned with integrated approaches to health. However, commonalities and distinctions between these integrated approaches in both political and scientific domains have not been clarified. Drawing on a narrative review of the literature on “One Health,” “Ecohealth,” and “Planetary Health” as major health-oriented approaches in comparison with landscape approaches, the aspects of landscape approaches to be complemented in addressing health-related challenges were examined in this study. In addition to the review on the intellectual roots and evolutionary pathways, a comparative analysis of these relevant approaches was conducted in terms of three realms including theoretical assumptions, knowledge bases, and research paradigms. The results of the comparative review show that all approaches share systems thinking, interdisciplinarity, cross-sectoral collaboration, and holistic paradigm but differ with respect to their focused management problems, disciplines, and sectors as well as ontological and epistemological underpinnings.

However, it suffers from the backfilling of its extensive network of waterways and increasing encroachments along its banks. The Nile’s waterways are among the world’s oldest and largest water irrigation systems. As an integral component of the Nile water system, they are vital in sustaining agriculture, inhabitants’ quality of life in urban and rural settings, and various ecosystem services. Therefore, raising public awareness and a sense of connectivity with the conservation of these waterways is one of the primary mitigation strategies for addressing the dire water deficit in Egypt resulting from rapid population growth and flow alteration associated with increased upstream damming. The large-scale degradation of the waterways system, observed since the mid-1980s, is perplexing, as Egyptians were historically more oriented to preserving the Nile ecosystem and the interrelated landscape for thousands of years. To assess the root cause of this phenomenon, we review the waterways’ public conservation campaigns and explore the grounds for their inefficiencies, failures, and subsequent impacts on transboundary water management. To achieve this objective, we compiled several research publications, local technical reports, and ground observations. Our results show that negligence toward the waterways accelerated during the nation’s transition from water sufficiency in the 1970s (1400 m3/capita/year) to the onset of scarcity in the 1980s (<1000 m3/capita/year). The water authorities’ delay of 15 years in implementing conservation campaigns, which were unhurriedly initiated in the mid-1990s, along with unsustainable landscape transformations, led to nationwide water misuse and sanitary degradation of the Nile’s infrastructure. Considering the findings of our review, we provide recommendations for improving the efficiency of waterways conservation campaigns. Our findings could be applied to other Nile riparian nations with similar environmental and socioeconomic settings.",2023

Food security and agricultural sustainability are essential for an equitable and healthy society. Increasing food demand, growing inequalities, climate change and pandemics are converging to undermine food security. These factors are contributing to an impending global food crisis, with 30% of people worldwide lacking regular access to adequate food. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to address techno-economic challenges in the agro-food sector by improving food production, quality, supply chain management and commerce. The innovations offered by digitalization in agricultural and food systems can help attain the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals. Here, we review the importance and application of digitalization in the agriculture and food sectors. The modernization of agriculture through technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, precision farming, and big data analytics has been emphasized. The integration of these techniques would significantly increase yield with minimal human interference, leading to environmental, social and economic sustainability. The adoption of digital technologies in agriculture allows for at least a 23% reduction in costs and a nearly 5% decrease in the volume of medium-level waste. Furthermore, digitalization in food safety and electronic commerce is increasingly being adopted.

To truly achieve sustainability, cities need to ensure that their consumption is compatible with absolute sustainability and validate achievements from a perspective that includes transboundary impacts. The aim of this review is to assess how well these topics are incorporated into commonly used urban sustainability assessment methods, using the safe and just space (SJS) framework definition of a minimum acceptable threshold for both ecological stability and standard of living. The review identified 277 different sustainability indicator frameworks that have been applied to cities and undertook a detailed assessment of the most commonly cited of these. Consumption-based footprint studies were separately assessed to determine the extent to which they measure SJS indicators for cities. Both indicator frameworks and footprint studies had a focus on boundaries of increasing risk, including carbon, water, and land use; however few measured highly exceeded boundaries including nitrogen and phosphorus use, biodiversity, and possibly chemical pollution. Social impacts were well covered in indicator frameworks, except food intake, but largely absent from footprint studies. Cities are largely not measuring their impact on planetary tipping points or transboundary impacts, risking resolving some environmental issues while exacerbating others.",2021

The state-of-the-art on these constraints' limits to a specific region, state, or a context; thus, the knowledge is scattered and not forming a global perspective on how and why communities' engagement in urban development has been hindered. Having a sound understanding of the existing barriers and challenges to community inclusive decision-making process is paramount for finding solutions for transforming current practices towards equitable urban development. Accordingly, this comprehensive, structured literature review aims to consolidate literature of the current challenges and barriers to community-driven decision-making in urban development and of the potential solutions to overcome them. A structured literature review covering indexed publications from 2010 to 2020 was carried out to identify and classify barriers/challenges and solutions that exist at present. Following a systematic filtering process, a total of 63 out of 1324 research contributions have been considered for an in-depth analysis. The study found 48 barriers and challenges regarding the current context, available infrastructure for community engagement, and current decision-making processes. Of all, the lack of communities’ knowledge and awareness, absence of meaningful community engagement, and ill-defined aims and purpose of community engagement were identified as the topmost constraints. By synthesising the current research, the study found that these barriers can potentially be overcome through attitude transformation and capacity building of both community and professionals, investment in community engagement, and changes to present stakeholder engagement processes and policies.",2020

CCUS was therefore proposed as a technological decarbonization strategy to prevent millions of tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 from entering and remaining in the atmosphere. In this review, the necessity and suitability of offshore CCUS in China are explored, involving examining the potential for sedimentary basins offshore China to act as carbon sinks for industrialized coastal regions and investigating the opportunities of developing a commercial full value chain. In China, the CO2 emissions from the 14 coastal provincial administrative regions are estimated to be over 4.2 Gt, occupying ∼41% of the country’s carbon emissions, whereas the storage capacity of the sedimentary basins offshore China is estimated to be 573–779 GtCO2. This could total 140–190 years of emissions from China’s coastal regions, which also avoids complex legal regulation and public opposition. However, economic costs pose substantial challenges to deploying offshore CCUS on a commercial scale, which requires significant technological innovations, national contributions, and business investments, particularly in the eastern and southeastern regions.",2022

Strategies, opportunities, and trends in scholarly literature","Circular economy, Sustainability, Strategies, Competitiveness, Systematic literature review","The concept of circular economy (CE) has been a topic of interest for researchers, managers, and policy makers. It is recognised as the latest attempt to balance industrial development, environmental health, and economic growth. Although academic literature in this field has been gradually developing, it is limited in its analysis in terms of economic and competitive opportunity in the face of different strategies. This article provides a holistic view by mapping the literature on strategies-based EC for the economic competitiveness of companies through a systematic literature review supported on the co-citation bibliometric technique. To this end, 126 articles were selected and organised into 5 clusters: (i) strategic applications of CE; (ii) mediating factors for implementing CE strategies; (iii) drivers of CE strategies; (iv) determinants used to promote CE; and (v) emerging digital technologies used to enable CE practices. The results of this study help practitioners assess EC from a new point of view and design competitive strategies for a circular model without neglecting economic growth and competitive advantage, in addition to serving as crucial evidence for policymakers, helping them leverage policies to circumvent sustainability concerns and promote circularity. A future agenda for detailed cluster-based research is put forward based on the identified gaps, including a framework to help managers set priorities to escape the zero-profit trend associated with green and sustainable practices.",2023

From a Digital Forensics (DF) point of view, this connection turns an IoT environment into a valuable source of evidence containing diverse artifacts that could significantly aid DF investigations. Therefore, DF must adapt to the characteristics of IoT Forensics (IoTF). With the increasing deployment of IoT, organizations are compelled to revise their approaches to planning, developing, and implementing Information Technology (IT) security strategies. The IoT presents new business opportunities but also simultaneously creates various challenges related to cyber-attacks and their resolution. For optimal preparedness in the face of future incidents, companies should consider implementing Forensics Readiness (FR). This paper thus examines the factors that influence IoT-FR within organizations. By systematically analyzing research efforts from 2010 to 2023, we identified the following factors influencing IoT-FR: (1) Legal Aspect, (2) Standardization Approach, (3) Technological Resource and Technique, (4) Management Process and (5) Human Factor. Furthermore, these influencing factors are not only considered individually but also in terms of the dependencies between them. This results in the creation of a holistic model including the interdependencies and influences of the factors to provide a novel overview and enhance the integrated perspective on IoT-FR. The knowledge of factors influencing the integration of IoT-FR into organizations is valuable. It thus can be of enormous importance, as it can save time and money in the event of a subsequent incident. Additionally, alongside these factors, various challenges, techniques, models, and frameworks are highlighted to offer profound insights into the relatively novel subject of IoT-FR and to inspire future research.",2024

The established concept of Food Security is well defined and researched, whereas the emerging concept of Soil Security is building its currency globally. Addressing Soil Security provides the means to improve food, fibre and water quality in a sustainable manner, through enhanced soil care and development of best land-management practices. Soil is a fragile resource which is degraded in many parts of the world. The rapidly growing global population has placed further pressure on the soil resource to accommodate increased demand for food, fibre and soil-derived materials. Such pressures are accelerating degradation and so novel approaches are needed. Literature search within this review demonstrated Soil Security and Food Security to be a convergence of disciplines. To truly identify solutions to challenges faced in either realm, an interdisciplinary approach seeking to understand deeper interactions between the two concepts is needed. Driven by this need, our review sought to investigate such interactions between the challenges faced in Soil Security and Food Security. Following assessment of these interactions, four potential solutions were discussed and included sustainable intensification and management, digital agriculture, circularisation and reducing the food demand trajectory through enhanced soil care. Soil Security and Food Security are interconnected concepts which will help facilitate implementation of the above solutions, and so approaches are needed which take this connection into account.",2020

The university-city relationship is also encouraged for the benefit of the city, as universities unleash their respective cities’ potentials to act as driving forces not only for their local communities, but also for the whole nation. Therefore, maintaining a mutual relationship between the university and the city is considered essential to accomplish strategic goals for both. However, the nature of this relationship is quite complex, overlapped, interconnected, and diverse. Therefore, this paper conducted a systematic review of the literature on university-city and campus-city relationships to evaluate recent research trends to uncover the aspects that connect universities with their respective cities. The search included articles published in 4 different databases from January 1990 to January 2021. A total number of 50 articles were selected in this review. The findings uncovered different aspects that could help or hinder university-city relationship based on the physical and functional linkage between the campus and the city. Moreover, findings have shown that it is necessary to understand universities according to their contextual differences, as universities have shown different impacts on their respective cities in terms of their sizes and locations. Results have also shown that the impact of the physical connection between the university and the city goes far beyond campus’s accessibility as it deeply affects students’ social life as well. Therefore, decision makers, stakeholders, and university administrators need to co-design campus development process especially in the early stages to maximize the mutual benefits of campus-city relationship. The main conclusions of this paper address several perspectives and lessons for a more sustainable campus-city relationship.",2022

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading has emerged as an innovative mechanism to foster the direct energy sharing among multi-level market players with pre-determined responsibility and privacy. However, compared with other P2P assets trading, P2P energy trading is facing huge challenges in achieving a large-scale commercialization due to the cooperation obstacles between non-professional distributed players and regulated players as Distributed System Operator (DSO), Transmission System Operator (TSO) and utilities. It is related to not only business and marketing, but also energy system operation to keep secure and reliable with injection of new roles, new utilization patterns, and new markets. This paper investigates the socio-technical interaction and mechanism for the sustainable P2P energy trading from the social dimension on the cooperation of multi-level market players, the technical dimension on the cutting-edge exchange of flexibility, and the economical dimension on the inter-operative decentralized/regulated marketplaces. Three questions are targeted on: (1) How Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enables co-creation of decentralized heterogeneous user-centered digital frameworks for the large-scale P2P trading interaction, (2) What specific energy services drive the cross-border interactions for exchange of multi-scale P2P flexibility, (3) How operational framework in P2P energy trading achieves the inter-operative marketplaces with the formation of trusted P2P energy society and the injection of multi-scale flexibility services. Finally, regulation challenges on P2P energy trading implementation are discussed for the guide of future work.",2022

This paper presents a bibliometric review of the literature on the low-carbon transition of energy systems from an engineering management perspective. First, the definition and boundaries of the energy system transition are clarified, covering transformation of the energy structure, decarbonization of fossil fuel utilization, and improvement in energy efficiency. Second, a systematic search of the related literature and a bibliometric analysis are conducted to reveal the research trends. It is found that the number of related publications has been growing exponentially during the past decade, with researchers from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands comprising the majority of authors. Related studies with interdisciplinary characteristics appear in journals focusing on energy engineering, environmental science, and social science related to energy issues. Four major research themes are identified by clustering the existing literature: ① low-carbon transition pathways with different spatiotemporal scales and transition constraints; ② low-carbon technology diffusion with a focus on renewable energy technologies, pollution control technologies, and other technologies facilitating the energy transition; ③ infrastructure network planning for energy systems covering various sectors and regions; and ④ transition-driving mechanisms from the political, economic, social, and natural perspectives. These four topics play distinct but mutually supportive roles in facilitating the low-carbon transition of energy systems, and require more in-depth research on designing resilient low-carbon transition pathways with coordinated goals, promoting low-carbon technologies with cost-effective and reliable infrastructure network deployment, and balancing multi-level risks in various systems. Finally, business models, nongovernment actors, energy justice, deep decarbonization, and zero-energy buildings are recognized as emerging hot topics.",2023

Past, present and future","Circular economy, Circular economy implementation, CE value chain, Challenges, Barriers","Shifting from a traditional linear to an alternative circular paradigm can foster economic growth and support sustainable capital renewal in the European Union. This topic has attracted growing academic interest in recent years. However, the evaluation of case studies regarding Circular Economy implementation, strategies, and practices (at all levels) is still in its infancy. With the aim of bridging this gap, this paper analyses, through a systematic review of case studies, the implementation of circular practices in all economic sectors and industries of the European Union (from 2015 until April 2023). To this end, this research uses a framework of circular strategies built considering the European Union political framework. Based on this analysis, it can be deduced that recycling was the most used circular strategy (24.2%) to reintegrate materials into the economic system and reduce the use of raw materials (18.9%), demonstrating the existence of virtuous circles in the European Union's economic sectors. The results show that the best performing industry, in terms of circular strategies, is Food and Beverage (17.92%), within the Agri-food economic sector. While the economic sector with the least number of circular strategies (7.86%) is Capital Equipment. This paper proposes several tools for Circular Economy implementation that could lead to future research and support business, policymakers, and the scientific community.",2023

Yet, how to precisely increase the spaces in which people experiencing marginalisation can address power asymmetries and strengthen their resilience, particularly from a methodological perspective, remains poorly understood. Here, we build on recent insights into political capabilities and their relevance for equitable resilience practice to assess the role research methods play in not only locating political capabilities but also enhancing them in the context of climate resilience. We present the findings from an in-depth analysis of 57 articles, out of a larger set of 200+ papers, that have employed co-learning/cooperative inquiries, participatory action research, participatory methods, workshops, and/or interviews combined with other approaches as most engaging and potentially empowering methods. Methodological insights through this analysis allow us to examine if and how resilience-in-the-making materialises across uneven power relations and often flawed decision-making processes. We show the pervasiveness of power differentials, even in research settings designed to be inclusive, and how disempowering processes in adaptation, mitigation, disaster management, and social transformation further marginalise already disadvantaged actors. At the same time, we illustrate the transformative role of alliances, resistance, shared learning, and sustaining inclusive approaches. Such nuanced insights into best processes as well as detrimental pitfalls are essential for development scholars and practitioners to help anchor deliberative resilience practice in the everyday lives of disadvantaged populations and foster political capabilities for more just climate action and policy.",2023

One solution is the development and mobilization of technologies that either 1)prevent plastics from entering waterways or2) collect marine and riverineplastic pollution. To date, however, few reports have focused on these technologies, and information on various technological developments is scattered. This leaves policymakers, innovators, and researchers without a central, comprehensive, and reliable source of information on the status of available technology to target this global problem. The goal of this study was to address this gap by creating a comprehensive inventory of technologies currently used or in development to prevent the leakage of plastic pollution or collect existing plastic pollution. Our Plastic Pollution Prevention and Collection Technology Inventory (https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/plastics-technology-inventory) can be used as a roadmap for researchers and governments to 1) facilitate comparisons between the scope of solutions and the breadth and severity of the plastic pollution problem and 2) assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses of current technological approaches. We created this inventory from a systematic search and review of resources that identified technologies. Technologies were organized by the type of technology and target plastics (i.e., macroplastics, microplastic, or both). We identified 52 technologies that fall into the two categories of prevention or collection of plastic pollution. Of these, 59% focus specifically on collecting macroplastic waste already in waterways. While these efforts to collect plastic pollution are laudable, their current capacity and widespread implementation are limited in comparison to their potential and the vast extent of the plastic pollution problem. Similarly, few technologies attempt to prevent plastic pollution leakage, and those that do are limited in scope.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112479,,A transition perspective on Energy Communities: A systematic literature review and research agenda,"Energy communities, Drivers, Energy transition, Systematic literature review, Multi-level perspective","The advantages of Energy Communities (ECs) range from giving energy end-consumers an active role in the energy market to the increase of renewable energy sources and increased efficiency. Yet, the emergence of ECs is not taking place across countries and regions at the same scale or speed. Reasons for this were studied but remain fragmented, as a comprehensive overview of these studies is missing. This study aims to identify the studied factors for the emergence of ECs. We used the Multi-Level Perspective as a framework to structure EC literature. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the gaps. The review consists of a 1) bibliometric analysis, 2) content analysis, 3) geographic analysis. Building on this overview, the authors highlight the current research gap and propose potential pathways for future research to facilitate the diffusion of ECs. It was found that although ECs are studied context-specific, generic factors have contributed to the emergence of ECs independently from their location, such as appropriate policy schemes and support for practitioners. Factors, such as the geographies of the transition, and cognitive-cultural factors remain less studied.",2022

Multiplatform messaging applications also referred to as cross-platform instant messaging play an important role in delivery of healthcare and education with its low cost, ease of use and accessibility.
Aim
To evaluate the existing evidence regarding the use of multiplatform messaging applications in facilitating consultations and decision-making processes in the context of burns care, as well as to assess the impact of such applications on burns care and rehabilitation.
Method
A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and PROSPERO protocol CRD42021265203. The CASP and JBI tools were used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Eight hundred fifty-three papers were retrieved from PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE and LILACS published up to July 2022 (updated August 2023) with no time restrictions applied.
Results
An analysis of the seven studies included in this review, inclusive of 16 Multiplatform messaging applications, revealed six themes. These encompassed the utilization of social media for directing and managing clinical practice, as a mode of communication, for evaluating the quality-of-care provision, for investigating available platforms and their technological features, measuring quality of life and for examining issues related to confidentiality.
Conclusion
Multiplatform messaging applications offer a solution for individuals with burn injuries to stay in direct contact with burn specialist clinicians for their follow-up and subsequent rehabilitation phase of recovery.",2024
