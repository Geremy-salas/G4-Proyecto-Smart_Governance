abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology for Bitcoin, is a distributed digital ledger technology that enables record verification by many independent parties rather than a centralized authority, therefore making it more difficult to tamper with the data. This emerging technology has the potential to enhance various authentication and verification processes in image sharing and data security. It has the potential to promote patient-centered healthcare by giving greater control to patients over their own data. Blockchain can also be utilized for administrative tasks, such as credentialing, claims adjudication, and billing management. It can also be utilized to enhance software supporting research and clinical trials. Blockchain complements artificial intelligence (AI) and these can work synergistically to create better solutions. Although many challenges exist for increased adoption of blockchain within radiology and healthcare in general, it can play a major role in our practice and consequently, it is important for medical imaging professionals to become familiar with the technology.}

abstract = {Solid waste management remains a challenge globally attributed to several factors including inadequacies and ineffectiveness of policies. Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management practices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments’ commitment towards solid waste management should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.}

abstract = {The United States (U.S.) coastal plain is subject to rising sea levels, land subsidence, more severe coastal storms, and more intense droughts. These changes lead to inputs of marine salts into freshwater-dependent coastal systems, creating saltwater intrusion. The penetration of salinity into the coastal interior is exacerbated by groundwater extraction and the high density of agricultural canals and ditches throughout much of the rural U.S. landscape. Together saltwater intrusion and sea level rise (SWISLR) create substantial changes to the social-ecological systems situated along the coastal plain. Many scholars and practitioners are engaged in studying and managing SWISLR impacts on social, economic, and ecological systems. However, most efforts are localized and disconnected, despite a widespread desire to understand this common threat. In addition to variable rates of sea level rise across the U.S. outer coastal plain, differences in geomorphic setting, water resources infrastructure and management, and climate extremes are resulting in different patterns of saltwater intrusion. Understanding both the absolute magnitude of this rapid environmental change, and the causes and consequences for its spatial and temporal variation presents an opportunity to build new mechanistic models to link directional climate change to temporally and spatially dynamic socio-environmental impacts. The diverse trajectories of change offer rich opportunities to test and refine modern theories of ecosystem state change in systems with exceptionally strong socioecological feedbacks.}

Agroecology is a holistic systems approach to producing food, which incorporates social, economic, and political dimensions. Agroecological practices include landscape and farm diversification, intercropping, crop and pasture rotation, adding organic amendments, cover crops, and minimizing or avoiding synthetic inputs. Social dimensions of agroecology include co-creation of knowledge with farmers, participatory processes, nonwage labor relations, collective property and management of resources, and addressing social inequities.

These current impacts are projected to increase in the future with increasing warming, acidification, oxygen loss, and sea level rise. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established to protect features in the ocean, traditionally with a focus to reduce fishing pressures and infrastructure placements. These MPAs are static in nature and are rarely considering climate change; therefore, their potential adaptation effectiveness as local adaptation measures for conservation in response to climate change are not clear. Here we discuss the challenges to Marine Protected Areas as conservation tools and for adaptation to climate change threats. We use two case studies from the UK to ask how climate change resilience could be included in MPA management to future-proof these conservation measures. We conclude that the resilience of MPAs to climate change would be better supported when adaptive management measures and an ecosystem-based approaches are adopted. We emphasise the need to increase the recognition in the primary legislation of MPAs and the monitoring of sites to better understand climate change as it becomes more pronounced, and impacts emerge.}

The objective was to identify candidate patient reported outcomes with potential to inform individual patient care and service development for inclusion in a digital outcome set to be collected in routine care, as part of an international project to enhance care outcomes for people with diabetes.
Methods
PubMed, COSMIN and COMET databases were searched. Published studies were included if they recommended patient reported outcomes that were clinically useful and/or important to people with diabetes. To aid selection decisions, recommended outcomes were considered in terms of the evidence endorsing them and their importance to people with diabetes.
Results
Twenty-seven studies recommending 53 diabetes specific outcomes, and patient reported outcome measures, were included. The outcomes reflected the experience of living with diabetes (e.g. psychological well-being, symptom experience, health beliefs and stigma) and behaviours (e.g. self-management). Diabetes distress and self-management behaviours were most endorsed by the evidence.
Conclusions
The review provides a comprehensive list of candidate outcomes endorsed by international evidence and informed by existing outcome sets, and suggestions for measures.
Practice implications
The review offers evidence to guide clinical application. Integrated measurement of these outcomes in care settings holds enormous potential to improve provision of care and outcomes in diabetes.}

The CIM helps in the search for information on future demands, providing a holistic view of the city. However, the absence of a full application and an established concept has been observed in the literature. Considering this, a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis was conducted, resulting in 80 articles that composed the final analysis. We identified five recurring topics in the articles, the most important of the CIM, and discussed them in depth. We found a direction towards the CIM concept: the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS), and a complete and up-to-date urban database, which enables analysis and simulation. The research concluded that a major effort will still be needed to establish the CIM, and its full implementation also depends on the dissemination of knowledge and demonstration of the tool's potential.}

In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.}

Rare diseases affect over 300 million people worldwide and are gaining recognition as a global health priority. Their inclusion in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Resolution on Addressing the Challenges of Persons Living with a Rare Disease, and the anticipated WHO Global Network for Rare Diseases and WHO Resolution on Rare Diseases, which is yet to be announced, emphasise their significance. People with rare diseases often face unmet health needs, including access to screening, diagnosis, therapy, and comprehensive health care. These challenges highlight the need for awareness and targeted interventions, including comprehensive education, especially in primary care. The majority of rare disease research, clinical services, and health systems are addressed with specialist care. WHO Member States have committed to focusing on primary health care in both universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Recognising this opportunity, the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) assembled a global, multistakeholder task force to identify key barriers and opportunities for empowering primary health-care providers in addressing rare disease challenges.}

Access to clean, modern, and affordable energy, also known as SDG 7, is one of the goals. Universal access to clean, modern, and affordable electricity is one of the metrics for measuring a good life as it fundamentally affects education, healthcare, food security, job creation, and other socioeconomic indices. To achieve this goal and targets, there has been increased traction in research, development, actionable plans, policies, and other activities by governments, the scientific community, environmentalists, development experts, and other stakeholders in achieving the goal. This review presents the various avenues by which AI and digitization can provide impetus to achieving SDG 7. The global trends in attaining clean electricity, clean cooking fuel, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and international public financial flows between 2005 and 2021 are reviewed while the contribution of AI and digitization towards meeting SDG 7 are highlighted. The study concludes that the deployment of AI and digitization into the energy sector will catalyze the attainment of SDG 7 by 2030, provided ethical issues, regulatory concerns, manpower shortage, and other shortcomings are effectively handled. The study recommends adequate infrastructural upgrades, modernization of data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities, improved awareness and education, professional development, collaborative innovation, and promotion of legal and ethical issues as ways of advancing universal access to energy by 2030. Going forward, more collaborations between academic and research institutions and energy producers will help produce experts and professionals to propel innovative deployment of digital technologies in the energy sector.}

Faced with drought episodes akin to other Mediterranean countries, Morocco contends with significant water stress, boasting limited water resources estimated at 20 billion cubic meters and an annual per capita consumption of 700 m3. The country experiences a temperature surge of 0.3–2.5 °C, coupled with decreased precipitation, heightening the impact of climate change on water resources. Morocco plans a 40 % reduction in emissions by 2030 (18.3 % unconditional, 27.2 % conditional on international aid) and an impressive 77 % decrease in emissions by 2050 compared to Business as Usual levels. The study offers a comprehensive, groundbreaking analysis, representing the first comprehensive review of Morocco's low-carbon strategy and energy initiatives. It meticulously examines 155 research papers through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, categorizing solutions into engineering and managerial domains. Covering power, transport, building, industry, and agriculture, the article provides a taxonomy of engineering solutions, including renewable energy, energy auditing, efficiency, sufficiency, and digitalization of management. Simultaneously, managerial solutions, ranging from education to subsidies and policy reforms, are detailed. These solutions contribute to Morocco's standing as a leader in climate action and clean energy transition. Despite these significant contributions, the article acknowledges potential limitations, including reliance on available literature and regional variations in solution applicability. Nonetheless, it serves as a foundational resource for understanding Morocco's endeavors in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable energy practices.}

However, there is no systematic investigation on how data quality can be assessed and improved for ML-based design and manufacturing. The aim of this survey is to uncover the data challenges in this domain and review the techniques used to resolve them. To establish the background for the subsequent analysis, crucial data terminologies in ML-based modeling are reviewed and categorized into data acquisition, management, analysis, and utilization. Thereafter, the concepts and frameworks established to evaluate data quality and imbalance, including data quality assessment, data readiness, information quality, data biases, fairness, and diversity, are further investigated. The root causes and types of data challenges, including human factors, complex systems, complicated relationships, lack of data quality, data heterogeneity, data imbalance, and data scarcity, are identified and summarized. Methods to improve data quality and mitigate data imbalance and their applications in this domain are reviewed. This literature review focuses on two promising methods: data augmentation and active learning. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of the surveyed techniques are illustrated. The trends of data augmentation and active learning are discussed with respect to their applications, data types, and approaches.

abstract = {Faced with the current time-sensitive COVID-19 pandemic, the overburdened healthcare systems have resulted in a strong demand to develop newer methods to control the spread of the pandemic. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about their use for supporting public health efforts. In epidemic surveillance and containment, efforts are needed to treat critical patients, track and manage the health status of residents, isolate suspected cases, and develop vaccines and antiviral drugs. The applications of emerging practices of artificial intelligence and big data have become powerful “weapons” to fight against the pandemic and provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control, such as early warning, analysis and judgment, interruption and intervention of epidemic, to achieve goals of early detection, early report, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment. These are the decisive factors to control the spread of the epidemic and reduce the mortality. This paper systematically summarized the application of big data and AI in epidemic, and describes practical cases and challenges with emphasis on epidemic prevention and control. The included studies showed that big data and AI have the potential strength to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet widely accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research would be on methods that promise value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for practice.}

A huge number of review research studies have been published that review previous IoT related research and more recent advances in a wide number of different IoT technologies and applications. However, as yet, there has not been any meta-review conducted to comprehensively analyze all current IoT review publications. The main objective of this survey is to present the research community with an overview and analysis of IoT review studies that have been published so far, and what challenges still remain that need to be addressed in this field. This paper also attempts to report the enabling factors that were identified, as well as the weaknesses and the risk factors in the current published survey papers. First, IoT review publications were classified into eight categories: IoT applications, types, security, data, communication networks, development, protocol standards, and technologies. Second, the bibliometric indicators were used to identify the leading trends in the IoT field. Third, a graphical/spatial mapping of the bibliographic material, journals and author co-citation networks, the bibliometric coupling of countries, and the co-occurrence of keyword network maps were developed from the IoT reviews. The results indicate that IoT applications, technologies, and security categories had the highest number of publications, whereas the IoT data and network categories had the lowest amount of publications, each of them had less than 5.5% of the total. The USA had the highest h-index at 56, the leading country in this field.}

abstract = {Many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and policies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These plans and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally, conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular, limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water, building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated frameworks are provided.}

abstract = {Rural tourism has been widely recognized as a means of promoting the revival of traditional villages and has been supported by numerous researchers. It has the potential to provide significant social and economic advantages, making it a popular strategy for rural development in both developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, a growing body of research has substantiated the significant disruptions that rural tourism has imposed on traditional villages. This study employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) qualitative method to systematically analyze 92 papers from WOS and SCOPUS that investigate the impact of rural tourism on traditional villages. The papers were categorized into five groups: spatial, economic, sociocultural, and holistic. This categorization allowed for the identification of the purpose, theme, sub-topics, research methods, and data sources used in these papers, which in turn provided an overview of the characteristics and overall trends in research in this field. It compensates for the deficiencies of lesser reviews that just emphasize rural tourism as the primary catalyst for the sustainable development of traditional villages. Based on a thorough investigation, this paper asserts that the development of tourism in traditional villages should be differentiated from typical rural tourism sites that prioritize the preferences of tourists. The primary objective should be to prioritize the preservation of community values, with a strong emphasis on community participation. This should be done while considering the interests of various stakeholders and promoting a diverse range of livelihoods that are rooted in traditional practices. By doing so, the essence of authenticity in traditional villages can be reinforced, leading to a greater sense of connection and loyalty among tourists. The preservation of traditional village genes fosters a symbiotic relationship with rural tourism, resulting in a mutually beneficial cycle.}

Almost all operational research (OR) is engaged with clients, but it is mainly in the areas of Soft and Community OR that wider stakeholder and citizen participation has been a significant focus. It is the involvement of citizens that is the subject of this paper. We surveyed OR literature and compiled a corpus of 62 studies, the earliest from 1970, to systematically characterize the involvement of citizens in OR processes. Our review produced three findings: First, some fields of OR have embraced citizen participation, but this is not yet a major concern outside the field of Community OR. Second, citizen participation in OR processes is often driven by a moral rationale. Third, progress in information and communication technology (ICT) enables broad participation, but traditional processes requiring physical presence can also be participatory. From these insights, we formulate research opportunities for OR. (1) OR may join Community OR's endeavor to engage with and empower citizens who have so far rarely been involved in OR processes. (2) OR may identify benefits and drawbacks of digital OR processes in empirical studies. (3) OR may determine whether involving large numbers of citizens is suitable for the societal scale. (4) OR may research building and maintaining trust. (5) OR may join efforts for data protection of participants. (6) OR may systematically report and reflect on participatory OR processes. (7) OR should continue researching the fair aggregation of individual inputs. Citizen participation in OR is topical and challenging. Pursuing these research opportunities will contribute to OR fulfilling its mandate of better decision-making in close cooperation with all affected stakeholders.}

Danish district heating is known as unique internationally in terms of heat planning strategies, technical solutions and combinations, energy efficiency and sustainability, ownership models and financing, and it has captured the attention of district heating communities and stakeholders worldwide from the early days. Historically, a ban on landfills incentivised waste incineration, and the strategic integration of combined heat and power plants and recycling of waste heat from industry all increased energy efficiency in the energy system. Ultimately, this contributed to the top World Energy Council ranking of the Danish energy system according to the energy trilemma criteria. A cooperative mind-set, welfare state values and the notions of energy efficiency-, availability-, independency- and sustainability were all pivotal for the evolution of the district heating networks throughout Denmark. Other unique features of the Danish district heating sector include large-scale collective heat planning, the mandatory connection, the non-profit principle, the same approximate price for customers irrespective of heat density, and the relatively high average price of district heating. Moreover, district heating knowledge hubs have led to world-wide exports of district heating technologies and know-how. Future challenges for the Danish district heating sector include increasing biomass import dependency, the changing role of combined heat and power plants in the energy system, transitions to non-combustion heat supplies, and competition from individual heat pumps in single-family houses. However, future ‘smart’ thermal grids will increasingly facilitate sector coupling processes as more renewable energy resources are integrated into the energy system in Denmark and internationally.}

While 86% of water projects acknowledged SDG interlinkages, project indicators did not reflect SDG acceleration objectives. For example, despite widespread acknowledgement of gender as a critical SDG issue, only a fifth of projects applied gender-related accelerators, and the bulk lacked strategic gender dimensions that addressed systemic roots of inequality. This suggests a strategic opportunity for the water sector to accelerate SDG progress through greater integration of cross-cutting programming.}

To verify this expectation, we undertook an in-depth, extensive review of the academic literature on this topic. Our review, which is time-framed to the years 2008–2018, distils five different directions in the development of IT/IS strategy research. It also identifies a shift in how IT/IS strategy is defined and investigated over this period. Moreover, we present an emerging debate on how digitalization challenges traditional IT/IS strategy wisdom. As this debate is still in its infancy, we take it further by entering into the larger discussion on digitalization, including digital innovation, digital ecosystems, and digital transformation. Building on this, we derive at deeper insights on how IT/IS strategy could, should, or should better not be understood in the digital age.}

Indeed, recent reports tend to ignore or minimize the negative effects of digitization. Because indirect effects depend on external factors such as regulations, prices, sociocultural contexts, and so on, extrapolations are extremely uncertain.

Employing a random-effects model and psychometric meta-analysis approach based on subgroup and meta-regression analyses, we examine 109 studies with 1,346,242 observations and 165 effect sizes from 2006 to 2021. The findings reveal that DTs have a positive and moderate effect on overall firm performance; however, the impact on innovation performance is the largest, followed by operational efficiency, and finally, financial performance. Moreover, the results show that the impact of AI on firm performance is the largest, while 3DP exerts the lowest impact. Furthermore, boundary-spanning conditions—contextual factors (i.e., firm size, firm age, sector, country development, sector technology intensity, time frame) and methodological factors (i.e., study type, sampling technique, type of performance measure)—moderate the focal relationship (i.e., account for between-study variance).

Many global cities and towns are facing complex and interrelated challenges associated with population growth, resource constraints, aging infrastructure, and degraded environments, exacerbated by increasing climate uncertainty. The United Nation's Agenda 2030 is a global call to action with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Water is the common currency linking nearly every SDG. SDG 11 aspires to “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable” and the water-sensitive city represents an aspirational future state for water management where servicing strategies deliver long-term sustainability, liveability, resilience, and prosperity. This social-technical endeavor is based on three principles of practice proposed in 2009. They have since been operationalized and adapted in many projects globally, and across a range of social, institutional, and biophysical contexts. In this Perspective, we reflect on lessons learned, required actions for mainstreaming water-sensitive practices, the next-wave research agenda, and opportunities to catalyze actions in sectors beyond water.}

In this paper, we focus on the activity of risk identification and assess the suitability of the techniques used for this process to be effective in the current networked supply chain environment. We do this by first surveying the domain-independent risk identification techniques proposed between 1980 and 2020 and study the type of technique they use, classifying them according to the proposed taxonomy and then evaluating them to determine whether they meet the requirements of identifying risks in the networked environment. We then survey the techniques used for supply chain risk identification between 1980 and 2020 and determine their suitability along with their limitations in meeting the requirements of identifying risks in the networked supply chain environment. Based on the identified gaps, we then present different solution considerations to inform supply chain risk managers of the improvements needed to be made in the process of risk identification to meet the requirements of networked global supply chains.}

abstract = {The emergence of peer-to-peer, collective or community self-consumption, and transactive energy concepts gives rise to new configurations of business models for local energy trading among a variety of actors. Much attention has been paid in the academic literature to the transition of the underlying energy system with its macroeconomic market framework. However, fewer contributions focus on the microeconomic aspects of the broad set of involved actors. Even though specific case studies highlight single business models, a comprehensive analysis of emerging business models for the entire set of actors is missing. Following this research gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of 135 peer-reviewed journal articles to examine business models of actors operating in local energy markets. From 221 businesses in the reviewed literature, nine macro-actor categories are identified. For each type of market actor, a business model archetype is determined and characterised using the business model canvas. The key elements of each business model archetype are discussed, and areas are highlighted where further research is needed. Finally, this paper outlines the differences of business models for their presence in the three local energy market models. Focusing on the identified customers and partner relationships, this study highlights the key actors per market model and the character of the interactions between market participants.}

This paper fills the emergent gap of critically discussing the concepts and their strengths and challenges as well as how they could contribute to each other. It compares: (1) the things that they claim to tackle, (2) the solutions they claim to provide and (3) the points that clearly distinguish one approach from another (if any at all). Not only does this make this paper the first of its kind, but it also makes it an impactful one. With each concept gaining various degrees of support in academia and practice, our discussion reveals where tensions exist and where positive gains can be made.

The unique attributes of distributed ledger blockchain systems including robust security, immutability, transparency, and decentralisation, make them highly suitable solutions for many healthcare-related problems. This review examines the potential applications for blockchain technology in the field of orthopaedics, by taking a systematic approach to the evolving blockchain literature and mapping potential use cases against the current needs of orthopaedic practice.
Method
A literature search was performed using Pubmed, EMBASE, OVID and the Cochrane library with the primary aim of identifying detailed accounts of blockchain solutions and use cases in healthcare. These articles were then reviewed and mapped against current orthopaedic practice to illustrate applications specific to that specialty.
Results
One hundred and forty-one papers were identified which described case studies, simulations, or detailed proposals of blockchain solutions in healthcare. Most studies described blockchain solutions at the simulated or prototype testing phase, with only 10 case studies describing blockchains in “real-world” use. The most frequently cited use cases for blockchain technology involved the storage, security and sharing of electronic medical records. Other blockchain solutions focused on the “Internet of Things”, research, COVID 19, supply chains and radiology. There were no solutions focusing specifically on orthopaedics. Many of the described blockchain solutions had considerable scope for application in orthopaedic practice however, providing the potential for greater inter-institutional collaboration, cross border data exchange, enhanced patient participation, and more robust and transparent research practices.
Conclusion
Blockchain solutions for healthcare are increasing in number and scope and have multiple applications relevant to orthopaedic practice. The orthopaedic community needs to be aware of this innovative and growing field of computer science so that surgeons can leverage the power of blockchain safely for the future of orthopaedics.}

To set the stage for this Special Issue we present an analysis of key research topics, most influential papers and innovation journals, highlighting contributions across four interrelated themes: fostering climate action, shaping policy, promoting experimentation and learning, and examining effectiveness. While past studies and this special issue made significant contributions, we suggest that research on innovation have not sufficiently engaged with three important topics: i) blending behavioural change with technological innovation; ii) the socio-technical drivers of accelerated low-carbon transitions, and iii) the role of digital technologies as new venues of solutions to managerial challenges in addressing climate change. The nexus of climate change and innovation calls for different disciplines and coevolutionary views, as opposed to a traditional disciplinary focused approach. It also may require the need for broader, more inclusive and interdisciplinary research teams.}

Tackling climate change requires significant behavior change to reduce emissions, yet the scale required is far from being achieved. Behaviors are influenced by psychological characteristics, social and cultural norms, material and spatial environments, and political conventions. Much social scientific debate continues to be characterized by calls for either individual or system change, but a more cross-cutting perspective to understand various factors that can enable and accelerate pro-environmental choices is needed. This review provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of evidence on the potential and limitations of individual choice to mitigate climate change. We identify six domains of individual choice for climate action (food, energy, transport, shopping, influence, and citizenship). We find that individual, social, physical, and political factors combine to shape low-carbon choices but in ways specific to each domain, demanding different responses from policy-makers. Effective climate action requires a mix of interventions which address the multiple roles played by individuals: structural change by governments (“upstream” interventions), businesses and local authorities making sustainable options more available and attractive (“midstream”), and informational measures to shape individuals’ decision-making (“downstream”).}

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being promoted as an ocean-based climate solution. However, such claims remain controversial because of the diffuse and poorly synthesized literature on climate benefits of MPAs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 22,403 publications spanning 241 MPAs and analyzed these across 16 ecological and social pathways through which MPAs could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that marine conservation can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms as well as fishers’ catch and income. Most of these benefits are only achieved in fully or highly protected areas and increase with MPA age. Although MPAs alone cannot offset all climate change impacts, they are a useful tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation of social-ecological systems.}

Hence this paper explores existing research to investigate the state of the art regarding the climatic impacts of PSS, alongside the set of factors that influence climatic impacts. The paper comprises a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature, quantifying the extent to which different types of PSS have the capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across multiple product categories. Our study shows that significant reductions in climatic emissions are possible, but PSS are in many cases associated with more modest reductions and, in some cases, increased emissions. Further, we observe no clear differences in climatic impacts according to the type of PSS model that is deployed. Rather, differences in climatic impact are influenced by factors such as production and design alongside use-phase impacts and contextual factors such as transportation and the energy mix. The study argues that further research is needed to establish a more robust baseline upon which to draw conclusions regarding the sources of climatic impacts, and outlines fruitful ways for companies to tackle the complexities of climatic emissions that are beyond their control.}

Currently about one third of food produced for human consumption is wasted and this accounts for a carbon and water footprint of 4.4 giga tons of CO2 equivalents and 250 km3 of blue water, respectively. In addition, food waste is responsible for significant wastage of land used for agriculture and 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Consumer food waste is a major source of the current food waste crisis. As consumer behavior is a key driver of food waste, strategies for reduction and avoidance of waste should appeal to consumers' individual values. Ways to prevent food waste, reuse and upscale recycling and recovery are reviewed. The potential of using waste for future food preparation, food waste avoidance tools and technologies are presented.

CPPS are mission-critical, attacks on them can have disastrous consequences. CPPS security can be improved by utilizing testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover threats, develop sustainable cybersecurity solutions, and evaluate grid operation in physical fault-induced or cyberattack scenarios. This Part-II paper reviews the CPPS testbeds in the view of the testbed type, targeted research area, CPPS domain, and communication infrastructure with the fusion of physical and cyber systems. Furthermore, this review gives an outline, framework, and application-based assessment of various industry and institutional testbeds.

Addressing this gap, multidimensional macro environmental and economic impacts induced by digitalization - such as direct and indirect effects, rebound effects, spillover effects and higher-order effects - are systematically evaluated to answer the issues about whether digitalization can contribute to carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the synergetic management of digital application and carbon reduction are closely related to the energy value chain. To this end, by overviewing objective and comprehensive scenarios related to state-of-the-art digital technologies in multiple sectors of the energy value chain, this study proposes an integral mechanism framework by theorizing an undefined field about digitalization towards CNP in terms of sectoral innovation, energy systems, individual behaviours, carbon-related assurance, and energy security guarantees. Accordingly, this study also contributes to potential directions and rising policy expectations about further estimation of digital effects, broader digital scenarios towards CNP and sustainable digitalization.}

The purpose of this study is to investigate and review the literature on sharia accounting and financial innovation to identify relevant sharia accounting models to be developed that can be integrated with financial innovation. This study also provides suggestions for future sharia accounting research. The method used in this research is a systematic literature review method that involves the analysis and synthesis of relevant literature. The findings of this study indicate that the development of an sharia accounting model in the perspective of financial innovation, makes sharia accounting more competitive, by offering fast and accurate preparation and presentation of financial statements, improving the operational efficiency of Islamic business entities, especially SMEs, in terms of financial reporting, compliance with sharia principles, and meeting the organization's social obligations. This research provides a positive contribution for policy makers such as regulators and investors in making policies, making regulations and preparing infrastructure that can support the development of sharia accounting models in the future. The limitation of this research is that the design is still qualitative so that it still requires more comprehensive and practical analysis, and encourages further research involving wider variables, such as the quality of human resources, Islamic financial inclusion and literacy, and the role of the government in strengthening the development of sharia accounting based on financial innovation.}

By analyzing 1021 articles published in 416 journals spanning the period from 2015 to 2022, this study aims at revealing Airbnb research topics and trends. The results show that the primary focus of academic inquiry regarding Airbnb revolves around two domains: the company's operational practices and its impacts on various domains. Within the realm of Airbnb's operational practices, four distinct research topics emerge as particularly prominent and extensively explored. These encompass the dynamics of ‘trust in Airbnb,’ the formulation and implementation of ‘house rules,’ the mechanisms of governing ‘Airbnb pricing’ strategies, and the critical examination of ‘value creation in Airbnb’ initiatives. Meanwhile, the most researched impacts of Airbnb are on urban tourism, rental housing markets, tourist destinations, and hotels. These spheres have received significant scholarly attention due to the profound implications and transformative effects engendered by Airbnb's disruptive presence in these areas. Moreover, the findings underscore that research pertaining to Airbnb's operational aspects has witnessed a significant increase in popularity over time, indicating a marked shift in the focal points of Airbnb research. Notably, the research topics that have experienced substantial growth include ‘trust in Airbnb,’ ‘Airbnb pricing,’ and ‘impacts on tourist destinations.’ Lastly, this study found that Airbnb-related research articles in hospitality and tourism journals tend to be more delving into industry-specific phenomena and challenges. Conversely, non-hospitality and tourism journals provide a broader coverage of topics related to Airbnb, encapsulating diverse areas of inquiry beyond the boundaries of the industry. This literature review provides valuable insights into existing research on Airbnb and highlights several critical areas for future research.}

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review of EIRM research in order to identify key areas of research progress and hotspots. This study used the bibliometric tool to analyze 6608 articles in the field of EIRM that were published from 2003 to 2022, which included research trend analysis, research power analysis, and research content analysis. The results revealed an upward trend in EIRM research over the past 20 years, with an average annual number of articles published of 330 and an average growth rate of 20.64 %. The countries with the highest number of publications in EIRM research are the USA (n = 1523), CHINA (n = 1233), and UNITED KINGDOM (n = 329). Moreover, the content analysis of these studies showed an evolution in the topics of EIRM research, moving from early medically controlled experimental studies to more specific disaster management and resilience studies. In conclusion, EIRM is a cross-disciplinary research field. Its important future research direction is to study how to process large-scale emergency information quickly and efficiently. Thus, it is essential to focus on overcoming the limitations of theoretical frameworks, technological development and application scenarios in order to realize a more efficient EIRM.}

Blockchain, the open, decentralized, distributed public ledger technology powering cryptocurrency, records transactions securely without the need for third-party verification. In the health care setting, decentralized blockchain networks offer a secure interoperable gateway for clinical research and practice data. Here, we discuss recent advances and potential future directions for the application of blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular medicine. We first review the basic underlying concepts of this technology and contextualise it within the spectrum of current, well known applications. We then consider specific applications for cardiovascular medicine and research in areas such as high-throughput gene sequencing, wearable technologies, and clinical trials. We then evaluate current challenges to effective implementation and future directions. We also summarise the health care applications that can be realised by combining decentralized blockchain computing platforms (for data security) and AI computing (for data analytics). By leveraging high-performance computing and AI capable of securely managing large and rapidly expanding medical databases, blockchain incorporation can provide clinically meaningful predictions, help advance research methodology (eg, via robust AI-blockchain decentralized clinical trials), and provide virtual tools in clinical practice (eg, telehealth, sensory-based technologies, wearable medical devices). Integrating AI and blockchain approaches synergistically amplifies the strengths of both technologies to create novel solutions to serve the objective of providing precision cardiovascular medicine.
Résumé
Les bases de données cliniques, en particulier celles composées de mégadonnées, font face à des défis croissants en matière de sécurité. La chaîne de blocs, une technologie de grand livre public ouverte, décentralisée et distribuée, qui alimente la cryptomonnaie, permet d’enregistrer les transactions de manière sécuritaire sans nécessiter une vérification par un tiers. Dans le milieu de soins de santé, les réseaux décentralisés de la chaîne de blocs constituent une passerelle interopérable sécurisée pour les données de recherche clinique et celles recueillies dans le cadre de la pratique. Dans cet article, nous discutons des percées récentes et des possibles orientations futures pour l’application de la chaîne de blocs et son intégration dans l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en médecine cardiovasculaire. Nous examinerons en premier lieu les concepts fondamentaux sous-jacents de cette technologie avant de les contextualiser dans le spectre des applications actuelles bien connues. Nous évaluerons ensuite les applications propres à la médecine cardiovasculaire et à la recherche dans des domaines comme le séquençage de gènes à haut débit, les technologies portables et les essais cliniques. Nous ferons ensuite le point sur les obstacles à leur mise en œuvre efficace et les orientations futures. Nous résumerons également les applications pouvant être mises en œuvre dans les soins de santé en combinant les plateformes décentralisées fondées sur la technologie de la chaîne de blocs (pour la sécurité des données) et l’IA (pour l’analyse de données). En s’appuyant sur le calcul haute performance et l’IA capable de gérer en toute sécurité de grandes bases de données médicales en expansion rapide, l’intégration de la chaîne de blocs peut fournir des données prévisionnelles cliniquement significatives, contribuer à l’avancement de la méthodologie de recherche (p. ex. par l’entremise de solides essais cliniques décentralisés fondés sur l’association IA-chaîne de blocs) et fournir des outils virtuels pour la pratique clinique (p. ex. télésanté, technologies sensorielles, dispositifs médicaux portables). L’intégration des approches IA et de la technologie de la chaîne de blocs amplifie de manière synergique les points forts de ces deux technologies pour créer de nouvelles solutions avec l’objectif d’offrir une médecine cardiovasculaire de précision.}

Citizens' interactions with each other reached such a point that they could contribute to the quality and quantity of e-government services. Examples of this citizen-to-citizen (C2C) interactions adding value to current e-government services or triggering new and innovative ones are increasingly observed worldwide. Although C2C interactions is not a new phenomenon, it is a relatively overlooked topic in e-government studies. Current e-government literature is insufficient in exploring and explaining the evolving nature, increasing occurrence, and various outcomes of these interactions. This article aims to fill the gap in the e-government literature by analyzing C2C interactions in detail and discusses how to regulate the C2C interaction processes and their useful and harmful outcomes. When C2C interactions get integrated into government activities and form e-government value chains (as in C2C2G or G4C2C), they contribute to the electronic provision of government information or services. C2C interactions also create beneficial (advantages of C2C) and harmful (disadvantages of C2C) outcomes. The main advantages of C2C interactions are their support for governments in making decisions, solving problems, and improving public services. Their main disadvantages are distributing misinterpreted or manipulative information, causing uncertainty, and even digital vigilantism. The article ends with suggestions for future research, such as different scenarios of government regulation for C2C interactions.}

For this purpose, federated learning (FL) was proposed as a technique that can learn a global machine model at a central master node by the aggregation of models trained locally using private data. However, organizations may be reluctant to train models locally and to share these local ML models due to the required computational resources for model training at their end and due to privacy risks that may result from adversaries inverting these models to infer information about the private training data. Incentive mechanisms have been proposed to motivate end users to participate in collaborative training of ML models (using their local data) in return for certain rewards. However, the design of an optimal incentive mechanism for FL is challenging due to its distributed nature and the fact that the central server has no access to clients’ hyperparameters information and the amount/quality data used for training, which makes the task of determining the reward based on the contribution of individual clients in FL environment difficult. Even though several incentive mechanisms have been proposed for FL, a thorough up-to-date systematic review is missing and this paper fills this gap. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review that comprehensively enlists the design principles required for implementing these incentive mechanisms and then categorizes various incentive mechanisms according to their design principles. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive overview of security challenges associated with incentive-driven FL. Finally, we highlight the limitations and pitfalls of these incentive schemes and elaborate upon open-research issues that require further research attention.}

The advent of mobile applications for health and medicine will revolutionize travel medicine. Despite their many benefits, such as access to real-time data, mobile apps for travel medicine are accompanied by many ethical issues, including questions about security and privacy.
Methods
A systematic literature review as conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Database screening yielded 1795 results and seven papers satisfied the criteria for inclusion. Through a mix of inductive and deductive data extraction, this systematic review examined both the benefits and challenges, as well as ethical considerations, of mobile apps for travel medicine.
Results
Ethical considerations were discussed with varying depth across the included articles, with privacy and data protection mentioned most frequently, highlighting concerns over sensitive information and a lack of guidelines in the digital sphere. Additionally, technical concerns about data quality and bias were predominant issues for researchers and developers alike. Some ethical issues were not discussed at all, including equity, and user involvement.
Conclusion
This paper highlights the scarcity of discussion around ethical issues. Both researchers and developers need to better integrate ethical reflection at each step of the development and use of health apps. More effective oversight mechanisms and clearer ethical guidance are needed to guide the stakeholders in this endeavour.}

This research aims to delineate the most influential elements of scientific research on AI ethics in healthcare by conducting bibliometric, social network analysis, and cluster-based content analysis of scientific articles. Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare. Practically, this research will provide a map for policymakers and AI engineers and scientists on what dimensions of AI-based medical interventions require stricter policies and guidelines and robust ethical design and development.}

In contrast to the conventional currencies that exacerbate security threats, these threats have been implicitly addressed by the notion of cryptocurrencies, which have a distinguished impact on their adoption rate among stakeholders. However, this potential adoption bubble may get diminished by the uncontrolled fragility in market conditions and persuasive increase in potential contemporary security concerns.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) or Web 3.0 is a growing technology that allows devices to communicate with each other as well as with the cloud. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), or Industry 4.0, is the industrial application of IoT. Industry 4.0 transforms production equipment into IoTs, which in turn transmit production-related data or their operational status to other connected devices or servers for rapid storage or processing. The results of the processing are used in real-time for the control and supervision of the production system. With the time constraints related to the availability of the processing results, companies have more and more computing servers. These IoT application computing servers are the fog. While processing IoT application data, fog servers require cloud intervention to offload tasks to free them up and provide data storage. Edge computing joins the game when connected objects are themselves computing resources. One of the main challenges of these technologies is the scheduling of dependent/independent tasks. Scheduling IoT workflows in the fog to optimize quality of service (QoS) metrics often requires offloading some tasks to the cloud in order to meet customer satisfaction and service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Therefore, many algorithms have been developed to schedule workflows in the cloud-fog environment. To organize this research, we present a literature review on scheduling workflows in cloud, fog, and edge environments. We outline a taxonomy that systematically classifies existing approaches. Finally, we identify challenges for future work.}

COVID-19 is disrupting and transforming the world. We argue that transformations catalysed by this pandemic should be used to improve human and planetary health and wellbeing. This paradigm shift requires decision makers and policy makers to go beyond building back better, by nesting the economic domain of sustainable development within social and environmental domains. Drawing on the engage, assess, align, accelerate, and account (E4As) approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we explore the implications of this kind of radical transformative change, focusing particularly on the role of the health sector. We conclude that a recovery and transition from the COVID-19 pandemic that delivers the future humanity wants and needs requires more than a technical understanding of the transformation at hand. It also requires commitment and courage from leaders and policy makers to challenge dominant constructs and to work towards a truly thriving, equitable, and sustainable future to create a world where economic development is not an end goal itself, but a means to secure the health and wellbeing of people and the planet.}

To address this problem, we propose a universal computational experiment framework with a fine-grained artificial society that is integrated with data-based models. The purpose of the framework is to evaluate the consequences of various combinations of strategies geared towards reaching a Pareto optimum with regards to efficacy versus costs. As an example, by modeling coronavirus disease 2019 mitigation, we show that Pareto frontier nations could achieve better economic growth and more effective epidemic control through the analysis of real-world data. Our work suggests that a nation’s intervention strategy could be optimized based on the measures adopted by Pareto frontier nations through large-scale computational experiments. Our solution has been validated for epidemic control, and it can be generalized to other urban issues as well.}

Yet, strategies for this integration remain a key challenge for urban planners and city administrators. Using a scientometric and systematic literature review approach, the objective of this review is to examine the state-of-the-art and current research gaps that constrain such integration. We find that while interests in the interrelationships between solar energy and urban planning have spanned several decades, the two remain largely unintegrated. Though a socio-technical process, the socio-political and socio-demographic aspects of solar urban planning have not received much scholarly attention. Consequently, whereas many software tools for analyzing solar insolation on existing surfaces have been developed, there is a lack of methods and decision support systems to integrate the results into urban planning practice. There is limited research on the subject in the global South despite significant opportunities for solar urban planning in this region. Also, a limited application of theoretical frameworks was found in existing studies. Future research exploring solar urban planning from the socio-technical transition theoretical perspective will significantly enhance the realization of this concept.}

Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.}

However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved. This can be dealt with as a future scope of research opportunities in the domain.}

By zoonoses management, we refer to improving the ability to address current zoonoses as well as preventing future ones. A total of 98 scientific articles were screened, of which 29 were considered eligible due to their focus on operationalizing each approach to help address zoonoses, as well as a combination of the two. Most articles implement One Health to prevent zoonoses by guiding stakeholders in concerted and participatory decision-making processes. However, the One Health approach can also be adopted via data modelling. Several articles refer to the monitoring and evaluation process of One Health initiatives to prevent zoonoses and discuss best practices to successfully implement the approach. Contrastingly, only three studies adopt a Food System approach to manage zoonoses, despite the profound connections existing between our food systems and the emergence of zoonotic risks. We conclude that there is a lack of integration between the One Health and Food System approaches to manage zoonoses. We also show that experts call for integration, so that not only human, animal, plant, and environmental health are considered, but also the socio-economic trade-offs when monitoring and developing strategies to manage zoonoses. This can be reversed, enabling zoonotic risks to be addressed when planning for our food systems of tomorrow.}

While the European Commission’s commitment to promoting NBS within its Member States and beyond is still an ongoing process, we aim to review the efforts undertaken, knowledge gained, and practices accomplished. This roadmap intends to provide interested practitioners, policymakers, researchers, as well as civil organisations with an updated understanding of the leading role of the EU in NBS conceptualisation and operationalisation. This can inform future directions of NBS Research and Innovation actions, which in turn address environmental and societal challenges prompted by urbanisation/re-urbanisation, globalisation/de-globalisation, climate change and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.}

This study analyzes literature from 2010 to 2022, focusing on how digital technologies such as open-BIM, digital twins, material passports, blockchain, RFID, and gamification can integrate into and enhance the circular building lifecycle. The findings reveal that while digital tools are pivotal in design and construction phases, their application to existing structures is less straightforward, with challenges including the absence of digital twins for demolished structures, the high costs of retrofit digitalisation, and the predominant focus on environmental benefits over practical implementation. The review also highlights the need for a unified digital transformation strategy and greater cross-industry collaboration. Future research directions are proposed, including the development of localized material banks, the application of RFID in circularity, the scope of Design for Disassembly (DfD) tools, digital inventory of existing buildings, the circularity of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) databases, and policy implications for promoting circular construction practices.}

The study reveals that between 1959 and 2019, several major floods have occurred, resulting in losses of life and livelihoods and significant infrastructure damages among others. Recovery has taken years and needed continuous investment. Unfortunately, many communities have not been able to “bounce back/bounce forward”, despite all these efforts. This study revealed that EbA strategies can be instituted regionally and nationally to offer efficient flood disaster adaptation or mitigation in flood-prone areas.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and global impact on health care, and has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technology. One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger. Blockchain technology has numerous potential COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications in health care. However, much of the current research remains at the technical stage, with few providing actual clinical applications, highlighting the need to translate foundational blockchain technology into clinical use.}

It requires salient, credible, and legitimate syntheses of knowledge on recognized (or emerging) issues for public concern. Beyond the ‘instrumental’ aspects of avoidable harm (nature as protector) and cost-effective care provided to people by nature-based solutions, ‘relational values’ invoke further foundations of morality and of human priorities beyond physiological needs and primary security. Effective communication in issue-attention and policy decision cycles involves acknowledging the plurality of value perspectives and (associated) decision-making modes.

This is important as recognizing definitions, rights, and obligations in the regulatory world, for the energy community actors, such as citizen/renewable energy communities, active consumers, and renewables self-consumers, is vital to energy community development. This enables evaluating the comprehensiveness of regulations for functionality of the realized technical counterparts, namely microgrids, energy hubs, virtual power plants, and prosumers. By mapping the energy community actors to realized technical counterparts, the key finding of this study is that for certain cases, a right, an activity sector, or a technical feature necessitates matching to an energy community actor with a broader activity domain. This brings unnecessary rights and obligations to the intended realized technical counterpart. However, technical features prevent claiming those rights or meeting additional obligations. The study is then extended to national legislation of selected European countries, i.e., Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, and Spain. Regulatory misalignments or improvements in comparison to the European legislation are also reported. To address benefits and barriers associated with energy communities, a survey on collective energy actors (e.g., municipalities, private sector suppliers, city councils, energy service companies, etc) involved in energy transition is conducted. The key finding of the survey is that rather than economic benefits, achieving renewable targets and participating in energy-based social activities such as improving the energy efficiency are the primary motivations behind energy community initiatives.}

This study offers a systematic review of the existing literature on aviation SST (e.g., self-check-in kiosks and web/e-ticketing) from the customer service perspective. Starting from a rich dataset of 678 peer-reviewed journal articles listed in Scopus, after some screening processes, 98 articles remained and were included in the full-text review and analysis. Accordingly, we found that the aviation SST literature focused on some geographical locations, e.g., North America and Asia, but not others (e.g., Africa or Oceania). Its three main research themes are customer adoption, customer satisfaction, and customer experience, in which the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the dominant framework. In addition, the use of SST from the environmental perspective was rarely studied while newer SSTs such as customer service chatbots and biometric check-in will need more attention.}

abstract = {Pursuing sustainability implies setting a multitude of open-ended goals to address environmental and socioeconomic issues today as well as those for future generations. The circular economy (CE) paradigm appears more focused regarding goals and agency to address environmental issues by using the economic system. However, companies and governments aiming to operationalize CE in practice, it has been claimed, will face six key challenges limiting the CE “net sustainability impact” potential. This work focuses on the challenges for manufacturers to adopt and operationalize CE for their business. The two key levers for manufacturers to navigate on their path from the linear (take-make-dispose) to a sustainable CE are innovating and designing of the business model and of their products. To date, however, understanding the role of product design in developing circular business models has received little attention in research. This review article builds upon the CE literature foundation, including definitions, challenges, and business modeling frameworks needed to better understand the role of product design. Building on the work of several highly cited CE-centric literature reviews and voices in research and industry, we selected and merged complementing frameworks: Slowing-Closing-Narrowing, Circular Design, and the Circular Business Model Innovation framework. To understand how to put these frameworks into practice, we analyzed CE's links with electric vehicle and white goods research and industry perspectives respectively and collectively. The review and analysis of CE and selected industries’ research was supported by a co-occurrence keyword analysis of 5,960 most cited papers in CE as well as the two product categories, electric vehicles and white goods. The analysis indicated limited maturity and linkage of circular business models and role of product design toward a CE in the research literature for the product categories. This result corroborated the knowledge gap and guided our focus in searching for further research and industry clues. We structured the clues of interest that were specific to or common across product categories and industries, using the integrated framework to visualize our Design for X conclusion. The merged framework visualizes how paths toward CE by design and logic of value creation, delivery, and capturing may differ. To conclude, the authors’ own experience and literature examples from relevant industry-leading and start-up companies are used to apply the framework and reveal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Future research and industry experiments focused on the circular business models based on product service systems and design for CE strategies identified, will be needed to test and extend the framework to other product categories and industry sectors.}

Solid waste and its associated environmental, health and wellbeing impacts and resource and land availability are becoming increasingly challenging to manage in remote and isolated communities. This is primarily due to the lack of infrastructure, land availability, high collection cost, poor economies of scale and low environmental awareness. This paper seeks to understand the factors that contribute to this solid waste management challenge and that hinder more sustainable management in a remote community context, through a systematic and critical literature review. 265 scientific articles and industry and government reports were collected and reviewed from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google search from 2011 to 2021. Barriers and enablers were synthesised and critically reviewed using a systematic literature review approach following the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. The review identified a lack of waste collection and recycling infrastructure, increasing trade and local economic development, low environmental awareness with respect to impacts of consumer waste products and disposal, and limited access to funding as the major drivers for the current unsustainable waste problem in remote communities. Notable impacts literature identified include water pollution (including marine environments), land pollution, and air pollution. Six categories of responses reported in the literature are: 1) technological improvements, 2) waste avoidance and reduction, 3) reuse and recycle, 4) increase government support, 5) inter-organisation partnership, and 6) innovative solutions to create value from waste. This paper informs policy makers on existing problems and potential circular economy approaches to achieve greater sustainability in this area. The paper also provides recommendations on a future research agenda to achieve such changes on the ground.}

Consequently, research on ICT/digitization and their impact on environmental sustainability has witnessed exponential growth in the last few decades. This study provides a systematic review of the relationship between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability over the period from January 2000 to April 2022. It aimed to improve our understanding of the different theories and channels governing the ICT/digitization–environmental sustainability nexus, to provide an in-depth analysis and discussion of the trends and main empirical findings of the reviewed articles, and to highlight key avenues for future research. In total, 166 scientific articles examining 297 associations between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability were selected for this review. The results revealed that most of the studies have used measures based on climate change and air pollution for environmental sustainability, and traditional ICT/digitization measures, e.g., mobile phone subscriptions and internet users. The results also showed that although most studies found evidence for ICT/digitization improving environmental sustainability, evidence for a negative association is concentrated in studies on the ’Group of’ countries. The results also revealed a scarcity of studies investigating nonlinear relationships between ICT/digitization and environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.}

To restore faith to accomplish green goals, it is proposed an essential shift consisting of a methodology to design a Universal Circular Cities Declaration (UCCD) based on the 2020 Europe's Circular Cities Declaration (ECCD) as a baseline; particularly, this methodology builds on (1) the empirical approach of the CC Definition of Japan that interviewed key stakeholders, (2) the ECCD report 2022, and (3) a four-step sequential process involved in developing the UCCD, consisting of evaluating the 10 principles of the ECCD, incorporating existing literature from desk research, establishing a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, and producing a blueprint for policymakers. A key finding underscores the possible skepticism of implementing it, and the responsibility of policymakers for crafting a coherent UCCD view to encompass cities, regions, and even nations.}

These sustainability assessment methods vary in their scope, target audience, selection of sustainability themes and indicators, aggregation and time requirements. This review paper focuses on farm-level sustainability assessment tools (or farm-level Decision Support Tools (DSTs)). Such farm-level DSTs are generally characterized by their user-friendliness and reliance on simplified models with limited complexity. They are often considered useful for non-scientific decision-makers. However, there is limited understanding of the consistency of these DSTs with the principles and normative aspects of sustainability assessment. This study has reviewed 19 DSTs to characterize the common methodological choices that tool developers made. Each of these tools was then reviewed with respect to the Bellagio Sustainability Assessment and Measuring Principles (STAMP). The results showed that tool developers are often faced with trade-offs across different methodological choices such as scope of application, geographic scope, type of modelling and level of assessment. Our findings also revealed that only three of the 19 tools considered were at least partially consistent with all of the Bellagio principles. In order to ensure compliance with the principles of sustainability assessment, tool developers should start from a clear guiding vision of sustainability, explicitly understand and communicate essential considerations, improve transparency with respect to methodological decisions and better integrate the end-users into the tool development process.}

Therefore, this study investigates the studies that used ABMS to study CESs, comprehensively analyse and structure this branch of literature, and suggest future research avenues. The six following elements from the Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) are used: (i) modelling purposes, (ii) agents and their variables, (iii) concepts and theories, (iv) initialisation and narrative, (v) network structures and interactions, and (vi) input data. The analysis demonstrated that particular purposes (e.g. social learning) and specific agents (e.g., energy companies) are neglected in the modelling practices. Furthermore, the developed ABMS are mainly focused on economic discipline, including topics such as local market design, and topics related to environmental and behavioural/institutional disciplines are largely missing. Such domination also reflects on the narratives and the networks used in the modelling. The most studied cases are focused on European countries and electricity-generating CESs based on solar photovoltaics. Further insights and future research avenues are elaborated on in detail.}

abstract = {Introduction
Current urban and transport planning practices have significant negative health, environmental, social and economic impacts in most cities. New urban development models and policies are needed to reduce these negative impacts. The Superblock model is one such innovative urban model that can significantly reduce these negative impacts through reshaping public spaces into more diverse uses such as increase in green space, infrastructure supporting social contacts and physical activity, and through prioritization of active mobility and public transport, thereby reducing air pollution, noise and urban heat island effects. This paper reviews key aspects of the Superblock model, its implementation and initial evaluations in Barcelona and the potential international uptake of the model in Europe and globally, focusing on environmental, climate, lifestyle, liveability and health aspects.
Methods
We used a narrative meta-review approach and PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched using specific terms.
Results
The implementation of the Super block model in Barcelona is slow, but with initial improvement in, for example, environmental, lifestyle, liveability and health indicators, although not so consistently. When applied on a large scale, the implementation of the Superblock model is not only likely to result in better environmental conditions, health and wellbeing, but can also contribute to the fight against the climate crisis. There is a need for further expansion of the program and further evaluation of its impacts and answers to related concerns, such as environmental equity and gentrification, traffic and related environmental exposure displacement. The implementation of the Superblock model gained a growing international reputation and variations of it are being planned or implemented in cities worldwide. Initial modelling exercises showed that it could be implemented in large parts of many cities.
Conclusion
The Superblock model is an innovative urban model that addresses environmental, climate, liveability and health concerns in cities. Adapted versions of the Barcelona Superblock model are being implemented in cities around Europe and further implementation, monitoring and evaluation are encouraged. The Superblock model can be considered an important public health intervention that will reduce mortality and morbidity and generate cost savings for health and other sectors.}

In this review we highlight the challenges facing energy networks from this transition in a sample of key high income countries. We identify the technical and other innovations being implemented to meet these challenges and describe some of the new policy and regulatory developments that are incentivising the required changes. We then review evidence from the literature about the benefits of moving to a more integrated approach based on the concept of a Multi-Vector Energy Network (MVEN). Under this approach the different networks are planned and operated together to achieve greater functionality and performance than simply the sum of the individual networks. We find that most studies identify a range of benefits from an MVEN approach, but that these findings are based on model simulations. Further work is therefore needed to verify whether the benefits can be realised in practice and to identify how any risks can be mitigated.}

Results indicate that generally, the use of blockchain is vertically driven by the requirements of markets and business competitiveness. The majority of the blockchain use cases are for traceability and storytelling, and to a lesser extent for payments or incentives. Moreover, there has been limited use cases of blockchain at horizontal level, such as decentralized finance (de-fi), enabling fishers to gain capital access and entering global markets. Overall, enhancing the adoption of blockchain should address suitability, incentives, and trust factors in using blockchain. As future prospects, projects in fishery and aquaculture could better utilize the full potential of blockchains by (1) incorporating financing, capital, and insurance through de-fi solutions, (2) providing tangible incentives, and (3) using automation such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) in data collection to improve quality and trust in data.}

abstract = {IoT data markets in public and private institutions have become increasingly relevant in recent years because of their potential to improve data availability and unlock new business models. However, exchanging data in markets bears considerable challenges related to disclosing sensitive information. Despite considerable research focused on different aspects of privacy-enhancing data markets for the IoT, none of the solutions proposed so far seems to find a practical adoption. Thus, this study aims to organize the state-of-the-art solutions, analyze and scope the technologies that have been suggested in this context, and structure the remaining challenges to determine areas where future research is required. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a systematic literature review on privacy enhancement in data markets for the IoT, covering 50 publications dated up to July 2020, and provided updates with 24 publications dated up to May 2022. Our results indicate that most research in this area has emerged only recently, and no IoT data market architecture has established itself as canonical. Existing solutions frequently lack the required combination of anonymization and secure computation technologies. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the appropriate use of blockchain technology for IoT data markets and a low degree of leveraging existing libraries or reusing generic data market architectures. We also identified significant challenges remaining, such as the copy problem and the recursive enforcement problem that – while solutions have been suggested to some extent – are often not sufficiently addressed in proposed designs. We conclude that privacy-enhancing technologies need further improvements to positively impact data markets so that, ultimately, the value of data is preserved through data scarcity and users’ privacy and businesses-critical information are protected.}

abstract = {The pursuit of improved quality of life standards has significantly influenced the contemporary mining model in the 21st century. This era is witnessing an unprecedented transformation driven by pressing concerns related to sustainability, climate change, the just energy transition, dynamic operating environments, and complex social challenges. Such transitions present both opportunities and obstacles. The aim of this study is to provide an extensive literature review on energy transition to identify the challenges and strategies associated with navigating transformations in energy systems. Understanding these transformations is particularly critical in the face of the severe consequences of global warming, where an accelerated energy transition is viewed as a universal remedy. Adopting a socio-technological systems perspective, specifically through the application of Actor Network Theory (ANT), this research provides a theoretical foundation while categorising challenges into five distinct domains and outlining strategies across these different dimensions. These insights are specifically tailored for emerging market countries to effectively navigate energy transition while fostering the development of resilient societies. Furthermore, our findings highlight that energy transition encompasses more than a mere technological shift; it entails fundamental changes in various systemic socio-economic imperatives. Through focusing on the role of social structures in transitions, this study makes a significant and innovative contribution to ANT, which has historically been criticised for its limited acknowledgement of social structures. Consequently, we propose an emerging market energy transition framework, which not only addresses technological aspects, but also integrates social considerations. This framework paves the way for future research and exploration of energy transition dynamics. The outcomes of this study offer valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners engaged in the mining industry, enabling them to comprehend the multifaceted challenges involved and providing practical strategies for effective resolution. Through incorporating the social dimension into the analysis, we enhance the understanding of the complex nature of energy system transformations, facilitating a more holistic approach towards achieving sustainable and resilient energy transitions in emerging markets and beyond.}

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) models, such as the PALM modeling system in this study, are actively used for urban micro-climate modeling. We consider urban LES in a broader context as a mature high-resolution model for integrated urban services (IUS), which is an initiative of the World Meteorological Organization that provides a modeling component for urban decision-support systems. A decision-support system requires iterations of quantitative information from knowledge providers and qualitative expert assessments from communities of practice. We present two pilot PALM-aided IUS from the “Turbulent-resolving urban modeling of air quality and thermal comfort” (TURBAN) project. One pilot has its focus on an air quality service contributing to a decision-support system of the port of Bergen, Norway. Another pilot contributes to air quality and thermal comfort services in the city of Prague, Czech Republic. Co-production sessions with stakeholders identified critical enablers for urban LES in IUS. We present integration and interpretation of the modeling information within the decision-making process with a “storylines and simulations” (SAS) approach based on a web-based geoinformation system (WebGIS).}

abstract = {Enabling energy storage systems (ESS) is a potential aspect of the energy transition toward decarbonising the energy sector. Despite the ongoing effort to analyse distributed energy resources enablers and key barriers, several gaps need to be addressed in the literature on accelerating the implementation of ESS at the citizen level. As citizens are now at the heart of the energy transition, analysing and meeting their needs and securing potential engagement in the energy transition is of utmost importance. However, this presents many challenges as it is more complicated to model and assess rather than institutions, organisations, and companies. This paper analyses the key barriers and enablers of ESS for citizen empowerment through the ownership and operational aspects of ESS. It evaluates various types of ESS at the citizen level, exploring their suitability and distinct characteristics in this specific context and thoroughly examines the key challenges, bottlenecks, and essential facilitators required for ESS citizen empowerment. It adopts a qualitative, bottom-up analysis of barriers and bottlenecks, providing a holistic view of the ecosystem. This comprehensive methodology ensures readers gain a complete perspective on the challenges present throughout the entire ecosystem. Also, it reviews good practices, examines key enablers, and suggests actions and tailored recommendations for diverse stakeholders, facilitating the comprehensive deployment of ESS as an integrated entity to empower energy citizens toward achieving an efficient and smooth energy transition.}
