abstract = {A city can be considered a carrier of multiple sources of data and information that are updated in real time and experiences continuous operation and development. Therefore, a system that can obtain and manage data/information gathered from different physical objects in a city in real time is needed. Digital twin (DT) technology is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle; it is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help with decision-making. However, how to apply these features of the DT to better manage smart cities (SCs) has not yet been systematically summarized and analysed. In this study, 202 papers on DT-supported SCs are reviewed, based on which the drivers and challenges of applying DT-supported SCs and the solutions for the challenges were identified. In addition, this study explored the possible outcomes of applying DT-supported technologies in SCs. This study also contributes to the DT-supported SCs for city management research and practice.}

abstract = {Objective
Existing medical care for peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, and other forms of noncoronary vascular disease fails to integrate mobility, pain levels, and other real-time patient-generated health data, instead relying on formal hospital- or clinic-based evaluations. Wearable technology, such as smartwatches, is increasingly common and offers an opportunity to improve care by allowing the collection and use of these types of data.
Methods
We searched English language publications in MEDLINE and reviewed some of our work to perform this narrative review of wearable technology for noncoronary vascular disease.
Results
A wide range of patient-generated data may be collected using wearable technology using a spectrum of devices and platforms. There is very limited but growing work using wearable technology focused on noncoronary vascular disease. Preoperative mobility monitoring, reduction of postdischarge readmission after lower limb revascularization, and improvement of medication compliance are important examples of potential applications. We also identified several barriers to widespread use and acceptance of wearables such as patient acceptance, medical team burden, and data useability.
Conclusions
Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, offer the potential to fundamentally alter the management of noncoronary vascular disease by collecting real-time patient-generated data. There are several promising applications such as perioperative monitoring and medication compliance. Additional work on regulatory issues, cost-effectiveness, workflow integration, and acceptance by patients and clinicians will need to be completed before widespread use of wearables.}

abstract = {The global commitment to decarbonizing the transport sector has resulted in an unabated growth in the markets for electric vehicles and their batteries. Consequently, the demand for battery raw materials is continuously growing. As an illustration, to meet the net-zero emissions targets, the electric vehicle market demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite will increase 26-times, 6-times, 12-times, and 9-times respectively between 2021 and 2050. There are diverse challenges in meeting this demand, requiring the world to embrace technological and knowledge advancements and new investments without provoking conflicts between competing goals. The uncertainties in a sustainable supply of battery minerals, environmental, social and governance complexities, and geopolitical tensions throughout the whole battery value chain have shaped the global and regional concerns over the success of transport decarbonization. Here, focusing on the entire value chain of electric vehicle batteries, the approaches adopted by regulatory agencies, governments, mining companies, vehicle and battery manufacturers, and all the other stakeholders are evaluated. Bringing together all these aspects, this literature review broadens the scope for providing multifaceted solutions necessary to optimize the goal of transport decarbonization while upholding sustainability criteria. Consolidating the previously fragmented information, a solid foundation for more in-depth research on existing difficulties encountered by governmental and industrial actors is created. The outcomes of this study may serve as a baseline to develop a framework for a climate smart and resource efficient supply of batteries considering the unique impacts of individual players.}

Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.}

The current literature lacks a contextual and processual understanding of AI adoption and diffusion in public administration to be able to explore such tensions. Previous studies have outlined risks, benefits, and challenges with the use of AI in public administration. However, a large gap remains in understanding AI tensions as they relate to public value creation. Through a systematic literature review grounded in public value management and the resource-based view of the firms, we identify technology-organisational-environmental (TOE) contextual variables and absorptive capacity as factors influencing AI adoption as discussed in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that outlines distinct AI tensions from an AI implementation and diffusion perspective within public administration. We develop a future research agenda for the full AI innovation lifecycle of adoption, implementation, and diffusion.}

As an innovation paradigm ‘co-creation’ is believed to produce more legitimate and inclusive innovation processes, however, in the context of energy transitions there is still no consistent understanding of what the concept means and implies. This paper investigates the links between co-creation and wind energy development to explore the (potential) role of co-creation for research and practice. We do that through an exploratory systematic review of 51 papers that refer to co-creation and co-production in relation to wind energy development. The review identifies three different understandings of co-creation in the literature, namely co-production of identities and representations, co-creation of innovation in sociotechnical systems, and co-creation as participatory governance. The three perspectives capture how co-creation comes about and how it shapes relations between actors present in the sociotechnical assemblages of wind energy development. We show how the use of the concept of co-creation suggests new roles for citizens as co-creators and co-producers of electricity and planning decisions. We subsequently discuss what these roles suggest for the understanding of participation in renewable energy development and transitions more broadly.}

abstract = {To ensure climate-resilient food and other production systems, countries must adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate-change. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) will significantly contribute to such adaptation and mitigation. In global, regional, and African contexts, Ethiopia represents a useful case study from which much can be learned. Therefore, the fourfold objectives of this Ethiopia-focused review were to i) synthesize adoption studies of more than seven CSAPs; ii) examine their adoption status, including gender considerations, socioeconomic benefits, and constraints to CSAP adoption; iii) identify gaps in the current CSAPs adoption literature, and iv) highlight future CSAP research and policy directions. Following a systematic literature review procedure, 100 articles published between 2001 and 2021 on adoption of CSAPs in Ethiopia were reviewed. Although all the publications were about the highlands of Ethiopia, over 80% came from the regions of Amhara, Oromiya, and South Nations and Nationalities. The most-adopted practice was soil and water conservation (SWC), with a mean adoption rate of 61.5%, followed by integrated soil fertility management, and agroforestry with mean adoption rates of 56.5% and 48.8%, respectively. Gender analysis was integrated in the studies at varying levels, including in all improved livestock management initiatives; just over half the SWC initiatives; and over 75% of the remaining five practices. Quantified socioeconomic benefits were reported in only 46 papers. Greater farm income; increased land productivity; higher yields; increased food availability; and reduced household poverty were among the reported benefits of adopters compared to their counterparts. Among the aggregated constraints, socioeconomic factors and knowledge/awareness were ranked the two highest, followed by labor shortage and limited market access. The study highlighted research gaps, especially a lack of national-scale studies and studies focusing on drought-prone regions. Additionally, 37% and 46% of the studies respectively, didn’t consider i) gender, and ii) analysis of socioeconomic benefits of CSAP adoption. This Ethiopian review reveals a need to fill research gaps in methodologies and practices, and at all levels in all regions, particularly in drought-prone regions. It identifies those CSAPs which could contribute more to addressing climate change, and emphasizes the need for greater gender inclusion. Policy-related actions should i) boost CSAP-related knowledge; ii) support optimizing their socioeconomic benefits; iii) address labor shortages; iv) improve access to irrigation, markets; credit, and farmers’ social organizations; and v) strengthen land tenure. In future, deploying remote-sensing technology, artificial intelligence and modelling approaches, and implementing Agricultural Weather Index-Based Insurance may also support CSAPs adoption.}

This paper presents an extensive survey of blockchain applicability for data dissemination in smart cities. We focus on the components of smart: transportation, healthcare, education, energy and building in smart cities and analyze state-of-the-art work on the integration of these components with blockchain. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of existing literature and evaluate the performance efficiency and the extent of security and privacy achieved. The analysis leads to our new design of a secure smart city data dissemination framework using blockchain technology.

Nanotechnology is one of the technologies that could enable such a green growth. This paper focuses on advanced nanomaterials that actively respond to external stimuli, also known as ‘smart nanomaterials’, and which are already on the market or in the research and development phase for non-medical applications such as in agriculture, food, food packaging and cosmetics. A review shows that smart nanomaterials and enabled products may present new challenges for safety and sustainability assessment due to their complexity and dynamic behaviour. Moreover, existing regulatory frameworks, in particular in the European Union, are probably not fully prepared to address them. What is missing today is a systematic and comprehensive approach that allows for considering sustainability aspects hand in hand with safety considerations very early on at the material design stage. We call on innovators, scientists and authorities to further develop and promote the ‘Safe- and Sustainable-by-Design’ concept in nanotechnology and propose some initiatives to go into this direction.}

The aim of this review is to examine the challenges to transformative governance of agroecosystems, and the potential to apply existing paradigms of adaptiveness in agroecosystems for this transformation. Agricultural production landscapes have been found to be a key level of governance for realizing sustainability transformations of food systems and the landscape concept has been a key paradigm for managing multiple social and ecological objectives at a landscape scale. An examination of the landscape concept using five transformative governance characteristics and applying the earth system governance research lenses illustrated two key areas for further investigation and action for transformative governance. The first is landscape design for continuous social and ecological changes and evolving understandings of sustainability, and the second is the allocation of landscape costs, rights and benefits in present and future decision-making and among human and non-human entities. Managing the pluralistic diversities inherent to agroecosystems will be a key dynamic important to governance and policy for food systems transformations.}

Traffic congestion and air pollution continue to be serious concerns, especially in large cities, and going forward, this is not sustainable. Urban transport around the world is facing challenges, such as air pollution and inefficient use of resources, that often inhibit economic development. Simply building more roads cannot address such challenges. There is a need to integrate the urban infrastructure through smart connectivity. Smart mobility, as a vital cornerstone of a smart city, will potentially reduce traffic jams, commuting times, and road crashes and create an opportunity for passengers to customize their journeys. In fact, planning smart mobility solutions is among the top challenges for large cities around the world. It involves a set of deliberate actions backed by sophisticated technologies. The different elements and dimensions that characterize smart mobility are investigated to depict the overall picture surrounding the smart mobility domain. Additionally, the trends, opportunities, and threats inherent to smart mobility are addressed. There are four segments of smart mobility that are highlighted in this paper: intelligent transport systems, open data, big data analytics, and citizen engagement. These segments are all inter-related and play a crucial role in the successful implementation of smart mobility.}

abstract = {As the world’s population increases, demand for poultry products will continue to increase. To meet this demand, one candidate mechanism to increase production is to increase housing and manage more birds. However, this practice, along with labour shortages and increasing biosecurity practices will make it increasingly difficult for producers to monitor the production, health, and welfare status of all their birds. Employing smart poultry management systems is necessary to increase production while minimizing costs and the use of resources. Smart poultry management systems include precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies such as smart sensors, automation of farm processes, and data driven decision making platforms. Many new technologies will have great implications for poultry production in the areas of the poultry house environment, bird welfare, precision feeding, and rapid detection of infectious disease. As smart sensors collect data in real-time on a variety of parameters from poultry operations, large amounts of data will be generated. To make best use of this data, big data analytical tools must be employed to produce data driven decisions. Additionally, the devices that will be incorporated into smart poultry management systems will be connected to the Internet allowing for the formation of Internet of things (IoT) farm networks. IoT technologies allow for communication between farm sensors, devices, and equipment, and will lead to the automation of multiple farm procedures.

For an agrarian and climate-sensitive developing country like India, CC is an additional burden, as rapid population growth, industrialisation and depletive exploitation of resources are already exerting pressure on ecological and socio-economic systems. It is in this context that this study was undertaken to gain insights into the CC scenario in Aravalli district of Gujarat state (India), its impacts on smallholder farmers, the adoption of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices, current policy options and programs, as well as the challenges confronting sustainability of CSA practices. An electronic review of published peer-reviewed journal articles and reports from scientific databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core collection, Science Direct and Google scholar) indicated that CC has negatively impacted smallholder farmers in Aravalli district with a poised potential to exacerbate inequality, derail smallholder farmers' livelihoods, and thereby hampering sustainable economic growth.The major reported impacts have been witnessed as droughts, disparities in precipitation patters, heat waves and temperature extremes, floods, emergence of resistant agricultural pests and increased prevalence of crop diseases. In response, smallholder farmers have adopted certain water, land, livestock, and crop oriented CSA management practices to cope-up with the impacts of CC. Being a nascent district, most national, state and district policies and program interventions are at proposal and initial execution stages. The review highlights the need to undertake more empirical research to gain a deeper understanding of the emerging patterns ofCSA and their impacts on agricultural development and livelihoods of farmers in Aravalli district.}

Scholars argue that food policy integration – policies that unite numerous food-related actions – is required to overcome dominant siloed and fragmented approaches and to tackle environmental and economic crises. However, what is being integrated and how such integrations contribute to food system transformation remain unexplored. This paper aims to disentangle frames and approaches to food policy integration through a critical analysis of literature on integrated policies and food system transformation. Complemented by a systematic literature review for “food system” and “polic* integrat*”, overlapping approaches and gaps between these literatures are revealed over the last twenty years. We use the prisms of processes (“how” food policy integration is being practiced), placement (“where” crossovers between sectors in governance institutions and where synergies between objectives can be created) and things (“what” specific aspects of the food system and related sectors exist within integrated policies and leverage points to trigger transformative dynamics) to explore how policy integration and food system transformation intersect within current debates. Our findings reveal cross-cutting themes and distinct theoretical frameworks but also identify substantial gaps, where frames of food policy integration often remain within their disciplinary silos, are ambiguous or ill-defined. We conclude that to achieve policy integration as a tool for food system transformation, a new research and policy agenda is needed that builds on diverse knowledges, critical policy approaches and the integration of food with other sectors.}

A wide range of definitions have been introduced in the literature to characterize smart buildings yet, at present, its’ concept and features are not clearly and uniquely defined. Simultaneously, building energy retrofit concept has been introduced to facilitate achieving the nearly Zero-Energy Building target and reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Up to 90 % of the existing European building stock will still be standing and in use in 2050. Thus, there is a need to upgrade the existing retrofitting strategies into Smart Retrofitting, to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building target and be able to respond to external dynamic conditions such as the weather and the grid. The aim of this research is first to review the concept of smartness in the built environment, highlighting the main features, functions, and technologies of smart buildings, also discussing the possible challenges for smart retrofit applications. The second part of the paper reviews the existing Key Performance Indicators that measure the performance and success in achieving goals in smart buildings. The need to develop a quantified guideline to improve energy and technological innovation is the basis for the increase of the smartness in buildings. Consequently, a set of nine groups of representative performance indicators for smart buildings is developed.

abstract = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

abstract = {The integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in healthcare, particularly in cardiovascular medicine, represents a disruptive shift towards enhancing the security and interconnection of electronic health data around the patient. NFTs, unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain network, bind various sources of health data to their owner (the patient) and delineate the access rights for stakeholders (providers, researchers) using smart contracts. Data sources may include electronic medical records from different hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, test centers, and mHealth devices. Accordingly, patients and their providers benefit from seamless visibility of diagnoses, medications, electrocardiograms, imaging, home blood pressure logs, and artificial intelligence-enabled insights from these aggregated data. Rather than being stored on proprietary servers, data are encrypted and stored on decentralized networks with a unified point of access and immutable proof of ownership, making them more robust to theft or tampering. As custodians of their NFT, patients are incentivized to actively partake in their health monitoring and self-driven research that aligns with their needs using innovative marketplaces that allow them to browse studies, document their informed consent, and monetize their contributions. Furthermore, they are empowered to educate themselves and seek care across siloes in traditional settings or virtual platforms such as the metaverse, where NFTs serves as digital passports. Despite these exciting prospects, adoption within the healthcare sector remains in its infancy, with ethical and technical limitations still being addressed. This article explores the multifaceted applications and key players in the field, and outlines use-cases for patient-centered cardiovascular care featuring NFTs.}

The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries.

In line with the current digital revolution with the rise of Smart Cities, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more common, including in urban forestry. In this systematic review, we evaluated 67 studies on the interplay between AI and urban forestry surveyed on Science Direct and Scopus to provide an overview of the state of the art and identify new research avenues. The sample includes studies in 23 countries and 85 cities, including 5 megacities, comprising the remote assessment of canopy cover and species distribution; ecosystem services assessment; management practices; and socioeconomic aspects of urban forestry. Most studies focused on extant urban forests, with few examples evaluating temporal trends, and only one focused on future scenarios despite the predictive potential of AI. A total of 22 AI methods were employed in these studies. Only half of them point to clear advantages of the chosen methods, such as robustness against missing data, overfitting, collinearity, non-linearity, non-normality, the combination of discrete and continuous variables, and higher accuracy. The choice of these methods depends on the various combinations of aim, timescale, data type, and data source. The application of AI in urban forestry is in full growth and will support decision making to improve livability in the cities.}

In this scoping review, we examine how digital agricultural technologies may enhance agriculture’s support of ecosystem services. Keyword searches in academic databases resulted in 2337 records, of which 74 records met review criteria and were coded. We identify three clusters of digital agricultural technologies including those that make farm management more precise, increase connectivity, and create novel foods. We then examine modelling and empirical evidence gaps in research linking these technologies to ecosystem services. Finally, we overview barriers to implementing digital agricultural technologies for better ecosystem services management in the Canadian context including economic and political systems; lack of policies on data management, governance, and cybersecurity; and limited training and human resources that prevents producers from fully utilizing these technologies.}

Although several literature reviews of SC research have been conducted, there still appears to be a lack of systematic quantitative and visual investigation and multidisciplinary scrutiny of the structure and evolution of this field. This paper conducts a scientometric review of the progressively synthesized network derived from 7840 bibliographic records from a topic search on SC in the period 1990–2019. Using CiteSpace, co-occurrence analysis of categories is conducted to explore the evolution of the disciplines engaged in SC research; co-word analysis of the keywords and document co-citation analysis associated with cluster analysis are further performed to reveal the development paths and research topics in terms of burst terms, text and citation-based clusters, citation structure, and pivotal points in the field. These scientometric techniques are combined to: (1) reveal the intellectual division of this developing field using a visual and comprehensive approach, (2) identify in chronological order the 10 core research sub-topics in this area with burst references and terms, (3) identify Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing as the most promising technologies for SC planning and development, and (4) conclude that smart sustainable cities and sustainable smart cities are the two emerging trends in the domain. Overall, this paper provides a visual, quantitative, and longitudinal large-scale review of the most recent literature on SC research, providing a broad overview and system thinking for researchers and practitioners with respect to SC.}

The systematic literature review covers the global time frame 1980–2021, embracing a sample of 17,061 articles, which includes: (i) timeframe 1 (1980–2008) with 8702 articles; and (ii) timeframe 2 (2009–2021) with 8359 articles; collected from the Web of Science (WoS) Scopus databases. Cluster analysis identified 5 significant clusters for timeframe 1, and 4 significant clusters for timeframe 2, allowing identification of the most prominent components of Civic Universities. The new taxonomy is based on three main pillars: (I) Open Innovation; (II) Governance; and (III) Sustainability. Academic and managerial implications help to position Hybrid Civic Universities as open and hybrid hubs without walls, with a transnational orientation targeting open innovation, digital governance, and sustainable development, respecting the values of diversity and multiculturalism.}

abstract = {Oldeania alpina (highland) and Oxytenanthera abyssinica (lowland) bamboo are two indigenous bamboo species and are vigorous in highland and lowland agro-ecologies, respectively. They have enormous socioeconomic, ecological, and traditional roles in the community. We address bamboo plantations and their distribution, identify factors influencing bamboo planting and marketing, and assess the role of bamboo for smallholder farmers and customers in Ethiopia. We also examine planting and management practices, governance, and challenges and opportunities for bamboo production and marketing. The decisions to plant bamboo are influenced by many demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as age, educational status, family size, income, farm size, land scarcity, bamboo culm price, and market information. They are also influenced by institutional factors, including market distance, marketing linkages, access to markets, tenure security, and psychological factors such as the perception of risk and attitude towards bamboo production. Bamboo plays a variety of socio-economic, ecological, and traditional roles in the community. It is one of the essential components of agricultural tasks and practices for most households and provides considerable cash income. For instance, it provides material for house and fence construction, furniture, wood fuel, and musical instruments. It is used as a source of food, medicine, and fodder and also for soil and water conservation, biodiversity functioning, and mitigating global climate change, as well as an alternative source of timber and non-timber products for rural and urban people, forest industries, construction, and energy sectors. Despite this, its significance has been affected by deforestation and degradation, overexploitation, increased agricultural investment, and social issues. Although there is a positive policy environment, there is still a lack of coordination, overlap of roles and responsibilities, and limited dedicated manpower and resources in the bamboo sector, as well as limited government support for the value chain development of the sector. Creating an enabling market environment and constructing a value chain are critical for the development of the sector. Furthermore, the selection of higher-quality bamboo landraces, extension support, and the local application of the established regulations are all critical.}

The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users’ daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.}

In this paper, we provide a critical review and evaluation of BCT as a core contributor to the targets set by SDG 11. Each of the 10 specific targets is critically evaluated herein with regards to how BCT can help achieve or potentially hinder success. BCT can serve to enhance the inclusiveness, safety, and environmental quality of cities. However, its implementation should be approached with caution. BCT could also contribute to a digital divide, raise privacy concerns, be unfairly leveraged by more developed regions, and even exacerbate existing environmental issues. While BCT has shown promise in managing urban crises, it is crucial to exercise restraint to prevent inadvertently aggravating certain challenges. Therefore, informed policymakers must carefully capitalize on the potential of BCT in their efforts to align with SDG 11. Lastly, an overview of the key areas for future research is presented.}

IDs are touted as catalysts for innovation and economic development involving a wide range of stakeholders often in under-performing neighbourhoods or precincts. Despite the appeal, critique is forming around their linear understanding of innovation, the narrow focus of economic goals and lack of directionality in addressing grand societal challenges. This paper proposes the concept of Mission-Oriented Innovation Districts (MOID). MOID are thought to help design, shape and drive transformative change from a place-based perspective. Methodologically, this paper conceptually reviews antecedents of and draws on a structured search and scoping review of the two popular but disjointed literatures on ID and Mission-Oriented Innovation (MOI). Drawing on an analysis of 99 journal articles, this paper seeks to provide a better understanding about differences and common grounds of the two strands of literature. Five analytical categories are developed and applied to assess and interpret insights from existing publications: (1) understandings, definitions, and objectives; (2) theoretical-conceptual underpinnings; (3) analytical and methodological approaches; (4) evaluation; and (5) governance. We find that there is ample opportunity for cross-fertilization of insights across these two literatures. Based on this in-depth analysis, the contours of a new concept of MOID are outlined through a formal definition of MOID and insights from the analysis are translated into future research questions to inform a transformative agenda for innovation policy.}

The purpose of this study is to discuss how enhancing the role of local institutions (LI) and incorporating indigenous knowledge (IK) in climate change adaptation planning can improve adoption and scaling success of climate-smart agriculture innovations.
Design/methodology/approach
A review of relevant literature from sub-Saharan Africa was used to answer the study research questions.
Findings
Embracing IK and LI in climate change adaptation projects can enhance adoption and scaling success of climate-smart agriculture innovations in smallholder farming. Such efforts will improve: information gathering and dissemination, mobilization of resources, establishment of useful networks with relevant stakeholders, capacity building farmers on various fronts and provision of leadership in climate adaptation programs.
Practical implications
Fully embracing IK and LI can improve the scaling of climate-smart innovations only if development partners recognize IK systems that are to be transformed and build on them instead of trying to replace them. Also, participatory approaches in scaling innovations will enhance input from rural people in climate change adaptation programs.
Originality/value
Development interventions aimed at taking proven effective climate-smart innovations to scale must, therefore, engage local communities and their indigenous institutions as active stakeholders in designing, planning and implementation of their climate adaptation programs.}

This paper presents the results of a systematic, state-of-the-art literature review with the aim of identifying the main technical barriers experienced by SLES in the UK. Originality is provided in the discussion of the key barrier areas identified during the review, which include those posed by multi-vector integration, grid connection, energy storage, smart technology and electric vehicles. The site-specific nature of SLES is identified as limiting the applicability of specific technical barriers, as is the need to view technical barriers within their respective social, economic and regulatory contexts. From the findings emerge three fundamental underlying technical challenges which face all SLES: diversity, uncertainty and integration. The findings also indicate that a more detailed understanding of site and context-specific barriers – and the relationships between them – is required in order to facilitate the mitigation or removal of technical barriers to the upscaling of SLES.}

Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendations related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.}

This digital transformation is also characterised by a change of paradigm, based on moving from computer-aided technologies to Smart Systems, which are present in several domains such as Smart Cities, Smart Manufacturing, or Smart Services. In this scenario, the exploration of the conceptualisation of Smart Systems has been addressed in the scientific literature with the objective to understand the characteristics of such systems and the implications of their use. However, there is a lack of a generic view of the concept since most studies focus on specific domains. This view is necessary to provide common ground for the development or implementation of Smart Systems within various domains, specially for those that have not been tackled yet. This work aims at addressing this issue through the exploration and analysis of conceptualisations of Smart Systems and Smartness within the scientific literature. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review is performed aiming at gathering papers including definitions of Smart Systems, regardless of the application domain. Text mining processing techniques are applied to obtain insights from the definitions extracted from the collected papers. Considering the findings of the literature review and the analysis of the extracted definitions, we enumerate and describe a set of characteristics of Smart Systems. We also provide a diagrammatic view of the elements of a Smart System and their relationships through a meta-model.}

Most reports or studies were published in 2019 or later, with federal and provincial governments being the dominant actors in reporting and monitoring, research, and funding. Across the 15 terrestrial ecozones in Canada, forest practices linked to climate change were reported in 12 ecozones, with most practices reported in the Montane Cordillera located in western Canada. Common forest practices reported include fuel management, assisted migration, enhanced silvicultural activities, and carbon offset projects. We conclude that climate change adaptation/mitigation practices in Canada are in their early stages of implementation. Many practices remain in experimental stages (e.g., genetic trials) or are implemented at a relatively small scale in Canada (e.g., climate-based seed transfer and carbon reserves). The literature suggests that the most mainstream practices associated with climate change mitigation in Canada include tree planting for carbon sequestration and the designation of protected areas to enhance ecosystem resilience. We conclude that despite increasing reports linking climate change benefits with reported forest practices, the reporting in the scientific literature is scarce, poorly reported, and often not grounded in credible evidence.}

abstract = {The prevailing global environmental distress, particularly in rural areas, calls for the adoption of integrated sustainable rural development strategies like climate-smart agroforestry (CSA) practices. CSAF is a new name for an old farming practice among the world’s traditional farmers, a holistic approach to land use in which trees, crops, and sometimes animals are combined within a managed farmland, a sustainable farming system and practice, and a pathway toward the mitigation and adaptation of the biggest challenge of our times: climate change. CSAF systems and practices provide a range of goods and services vital for human well-being, particularly for people who live below the poverty line. Yet a number of important knowledge, research, and adoption gaps remain regarding human-environment interactions, and the urgency behind these gaps reflects the need to inform evidence-based policymaking and practice to realize the potential for CSAF to support farmers' livelihoods. We conducted a review of CSAF system practices that contribute to achieving the SDGs, in particular those related to increased human well-being, and prosperity, soil and water conservation, bioenergy, climate change response, biodiversity conservation, and landscape management, from the SDGs outlook. The study specifically identifies, (i) what has been innovatively achieved in CSAF practices to cope with climate risks for environmental stability, improved farm productivity, farm income, and food security (what works), (ii) challenges facing smallholder farmers to adopt CSAF practices (what doesn’t work), and (iii) room for a significant contribution of CSAF practices in smallholder farmers' productivity beyond what has been observed. Generally, the results show that CSAF practices have the potential to optimize different socio-economic returns and sustain environmental services. Farming with CSAF technologies has many advantages in both ecological and economic aspects that support the achievement of several of the SDGs, specifically SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG5 (gender equality), SDG6 (clean water and proper sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG13 (climate action), and SDG15 (life on land). Results showed that despite its contribution to the SDGs and its global widespread, the challenge remains linking knowledge and action in CSAF research, education, and capacity development. Farmers will not be able to solve the challenge of sustainable agriculture by themselves. Thus, efforts are required from both the public and the industry and effective public-private partnerships along the agricultural and food value chain. There are multidimensional aspects to CSAF which require in-depth scientific analysis for the extensive application of CSAF practices in sustainable land management endeavors. Moreover, in this perspective, CSAF should keep its identity while seeking a role in the nexus of SDGs. We hope this review will provide a clearer picture of what the state-of-the-art in practicing smarter technologies in a changing climate is and provide a more holistic understanding of CSAF systems and practices, and the gaps regarding human-environment interactions, and the way forward to overcoming them.}

Technological advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) provide a broad range of energy sector applications, such as transmission and distribution, energy supply, power generation, renewable energy integration, load demand management, etc. We have conducted a comprehensive and critical IoT study on business applications and smart energy systems for this objective. Four main areas of smart energy systems have been chosen, including: i) the use of IoT in business; (ii) the use of IoT in smart energy applications; (iii) the use of IoT in data transmission networks; and (iv) the use of IoT in power generation and terminal hardware/devices. Each research area is further divided into different sub-areas; for example, IoT business includes energy operational policy, energy management and planning, energy management systems, business models, and customer services. Energy forecasting, state monitoring and estimation, anomaly detection, data mining and visualization are among the IoT applications in smart energy systems. Cloud computing, edge computing, and quantum computing are provided using IoT in data transmission networks. A variety of renewable sources, pricing, and load management strategies involve the use of IoT in energy generation. Many new solutions for smart energy systems are provided with critical thinking and clear vision, and key industries for IoT revenue generation and application development are described. This study aimed to provide a clear insight into IoT devices' recent developments in smart energy systems, supported by high-quality published literature. It is noted that in 2015, the IoT worldwide energy market exceeded USD 6.8 billion and is projected to reach USD 26.5 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.5 % in 2016−23.}

They provide a measurable third-party approach to ensuring sustainability design and directives are met through the use of indictors, criteria’s and credit system. A key challenge is that the existing tools such as BREEAM Communities and LEED Neighbourhood Development address a wider community but cannot efficiently address the more nuanced and context specific sustainability requirements of campuses. However, the approach of utilizing credits, indicator and criteria systems is a tactic that campus planners have slowly began to imbibe. This is even more critical to sustainable development cities due to the huge amounts of land and human resources consumed on campuses; However, gaps exist within the currently existing Campus Sustainability Assessment Tools (CSAT) that have been developed. Generally. Though studies have identified trends and gaps in neighbourhood and building assessment tools, no comprehensive study has investigated the potential gaps from the newly emerging CSATs. Using bibliometric analysis, this study reviews over 1000 articles on campus sustainability and assessment tools with the aim of determining the gaps, trends and focus area of campus sustainability via CSAT. The result draw out 15 dimensions that govern the design of sustainable campuses, and the most predominant dimensions were environmental, educational and governance dimension. The results also highlight the importance of context in implementing and developing CSATs and showed numerous overlooked campus sustainability issues, which have considerable impact on the determining the claims that makes campuses sustainable. Finally, results demonstrated a need to enhance inclusivity in decision making on campus via different survey techniques in both education and implementation of campus sustainability initiatives. In sum this study enhances the development of new CSAT and campus sustainability initiative and the modification existing initiatives to effectively meet the required sustainability standards within the built environment.}

The paper dwelt largely on a review of literature on the subject, which was accessed from a wide range of databases using online search engines and by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicate that smart homes enhance the comfort of the dwellers, ensure the diversification of energy sources and use, promote inclusiveness in the provision of housing and present an avenue for environmental cleanliness. Based on these benefits, and in an era of sustainable cities, the authorities of the cities in North America and Europe are encouraging the adoption of smart homes by urbanites. However, there is insufficient data to assess the level of adoption of smart housing in SSA although anecdotally the rate of adoption may be low. This is partly attributed to the region’s low levels of literacy, income and technological penetration. The paper recommends the strengthening of local economies, creating awareness about the value of smart homes, creating smart home incentives and adapting the design of affordable housing schemes to assume the nature of smart homes as good strategies to foster a sustainable adoption of smart housing in the sub-region.}

abstract = {Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is seeking to overcome the food security problem and develop rural livelihoods while minimizing negative impacts on the environment. However, when such synergies exist, the situation of small-scale farmers is often overlooked, and they are unable to implement new practices and technologies. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to improve CSA by adding the neglected but very important element “small-scale farmer”, and introduce Vulnerable-Smart Agriculture (VSA) as a complete version of CSA. VSA indicates, based on the results of this study, that none of the decisions made by policymakers can be realistic and functional as long as the voice of the farmers influenced by their decisions is not heard. Therefore, to identify different levels for possible interventions and develop VSA monitoring indicators, a new conceptual framework needs to be developed. This study proposed such a framework consisting of five elements: prediction of critical incidents by farmers, measuring the consequences of incidents, identifying farmers' coping strategies, assessing farmers' livelihood capital when facing an incident, and adapting to climate incidents. The primary focus of this study is on farmers’ learning and operational preparation to deal with tension and disasters at farm level. Understanding the implications of threats from climate change and the recognizing of coping mechanisms will contribute to an increase in understanding sustainable management.}

Since smart city initiatives are citizen-focused, public administrators must have strategies and plans for promoting citizenship as well as understanding how citizens use smart city technologies to develop sustainable smart city efforts. However, current knowledge of development and use issues relating to 311 system is limited. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence 311 system user behaviors with respect to the creation of citizen-generated data to help improve the management of citizen relationships. The results demonstrated that individual differences were viewed as a catalyst for user behaviors and have both a direct and indirect influence on such behaviors. These differences in views, along with technology acceptance theory and citizen-initiated contact theory, all emphasize the factors influencing citizen behaviors in 311 citizen-initiated contact and 311 contact channel choices. In addition, technology acceptance, satisfaction with the neighborhood environment, and frequent use of public services are characteristics exhibited by those who use 311 system more frequently. Significant evidence regarding the causal relationship between these three variables shows that 311 system is both service consumer-oriented and user-oriented and, as a result, reduces the gap between supply side and demand side in the adoption of governmental ICTs, which is viewed as a daunting challenge in the study of governmental ICTs and digital governance.}

The paper begins by discussing the carbon impact of the sector and the concept of ‘smart campuses' applied to the sector in the context of decarbonisation. Opportunities and challenges associated with integrating smart energy systems at the university campus from a policy and technical perspective are then discussed. This is followed by a review of building and campus-scale frameworks supporting a transition to smart energy campuses using the BPIE’ Smart Buildings' framework. The paper finds that the complexity of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for new and existing higher education buildings and energy systems can be addressed with the adoption of ‘smart building principles' and integrating 'smartness' into their energy systems. Several universities in the UK and worldwide are integrating smart services and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their operations following the smart campus premise. At the building level, existing frameworks often create conceptual roadmaps for the smart building premise or propose technical implementation and assessment methods. At university campus scale, implementation typically comes through single-vector interventions, and only few examples exist that propose a multi-vector approach. Comparisons of the drivers and the decision-making process are made, with carbon and cost reduction being the most prominent from leveraging distributed energy generation. Therefore, this study identified the need for a comprehensive technical or policy framework to drive the uptake of the smart energy campus, aiming to bring together the holistic value of smart energy campuses.}

Despite global efforts to consolidate circular practices, policies addressing the bioeconomy, particularly in urban ecosystems, remain ambiguous concerning the availability of resources and the value of ecosystem services. To address these gaps, we conducted an integrative literature review centred on the underlying constructs that drive the development of narratives. We identify several critical factors, such as public-private partnerships, political support for circular initiatives, and collaboration with local authorities. We also advocate and propose the synergy of decentralisation and colocation practices and the need to promote low-entropy urban ecosystems. By highlighting the theoretical links between theory, definitions, core constructs, and essential practices, this paper outlines approaches to assessing the impact of the urban circular bioeconomy on sustainable development. By further investigating these links, the paper provides valuable information and recommendations for future research.}

This integration enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of electricity demand and supply. However, the increasing reliance on ICT infrastructures has made the SG-CPS more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, securing the SG-CPS from these threats is crucial for its reliable operation. In recent literature, machine learning (ML) techniques and, more recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been used by several studies to implement cybersecurity countermeasures against cyberattacks in SG-CPS. Nevertheless, the achieving high performance of these state-of-the-art techniques is constrained by certain challenges, including hyperparameter optimization, feature extraction and selection, lack of models’ transparency, data privacy, and lack of real-time attack data. This paper reviews the advancement in using ML and DL techniques for cybersecurity countermeasures in SG-CPS. It analyzes the constraints that need to be addressed to improve performance and achieve real-time implementation. The various types of cyberattacks, cybersecurity requirements, and security standards and protocols are also discussed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity context in SG-CPS.

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

abstract = {With increasing population, the demand for agricultural productivity is rising to meet the goal of “Zero Hunger”. Consequently, farmers have optimized the agricultural activities in a sustainable way with the modern technologies. This integration has boosted the agriculture production due to high potentiality in assisting the farmers. The impulse towards the technological advancement has revived the traditional agriculture methods and resulted in eco-friendly, sustainable, and efficient farming. This has revolutionized the era of smart farming which primarily alliance with modern technologies like, big data, machine learning, deep learning, swarm intelligence, internet-of-things, block chain, robotics and autonomous system, cloud-fog-edge computing, cyber physical systems, and generative adversarial networks (GAN). To cater the same, a detailed survey on ten hot-spots of smart farming is presented in this paper. The survey covers the technology-wise state-of-the-art methods along with their application domains. Moreover, the publicly available data sets with existing research challenges are investigated. Lastly, the paper concludes with suggestions to the identified problems and possible future research directions.}

abstract = {Due to the relatively large uncertainty and high cost of the power generation of the multi-energy power grid system, the power grid optimization scheduling with these problems as the object of the solution needs to take more targeted optimization measures. The purpose of this paper was to study a better grid system optimization scheme, and an improved mixed integer linear algorithm was proposed. And based on this algorithm, the multi-energy power grid system of a smart stadium was optimized, and at the same time, the common particle swarm algorithm was used to optimize the power grid system to compare the effects. The experimental results showed that the total monthly power supply cost of the optimized power grid system based on the improved mixed integer linear algorithm was 2061.2 yuan, the maximum pollution reduction was 17.3%, and the power supply system working time was reduced by 4.2% on average. The total monthly power supply cost of the optimized power grid system based on particle swarm algorithm was 2126.1 yuan, the highest pollution reduction was 12.6%, and the power supply system working time was reduced by 5.7% on average. In contrast, it can be seen that compared with the optimization of particle swarm optimization, the optimized multi-energy grid system of smart stadiums based on the improved mixed integer linear algorithm reduces more power supply costs, increases the stability of power supply power, and reduces more pollution emissions, but it is not effective in reducing system working time.}

abstract = {Over the past few decades, the proliferation of distributed generation (DG), fuelled chiefly by environmental concerns, has brought about fundamental changes to the structure and behaviour of the power grid. These changes have spawned new challenges in the way with which the power grid should be managed. As a result, the development of new modelling approaches, as well as management techniques deemed “smart”, is called for to better monitor and control this increasingly complex system by taking into account the specificities of distributed generators (DGs) and their impact on the grid. This paper explores the evolution of power grids into “smart grids” in the light of the penetration of distributed generation and the features that ensue. Then, it gives an overview of notable works in the literature aimed at the modelling and control of power grids within this framework. The reader is provided with an in-depth analysis of a variety of methods through the lens of the applications for which they are most suited. Though well-established methods that have been in use for infrastructure planning for decades, such as optimal power flow (OPF), remain reliable tools, cutting-edge research in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS) opens the door to putting a myriad of complex numerical algorithms in the service of power grid monitoring and control. In addition, a special interest is paid to demand-side management (DSM) techniques.}

Home energy usage is expected to increase by more than 40% in the next 20 years. Therefore, to compensate for demand requirements, proper planning and strategies are needed to improve home energy management systems (HEMs). One of the crucial aspects of HEMS are proper load forecasting and scheduling of energy utilization. Energy management systems depend heavily on precise forecasting and scheduling. Considering this scenario, this article was divided into two parts. Firstly, this article gives a thorough analysis of forecasting models in HEMs with the primary goal of determining whichever model is most appropriate in a given situation. Moreover, for optimal utilization of scheduling strategies in HEMs, the current literature has discussed a number of scheduling optimization approaches. Therefore, secondly in this article, these approaches will be examined thoroughly to develop effective operating scheduling and to make wise judgments regarding usage of these techniques in HEMs. Finally, this paper also presents the future technical advancements and research gaps in load forecasting and scheduling and how they affect HEMs activities in the near future.}

In the field of rare connective tissue diseases (rCTDs), these opportunities include increased access to scarce and remote expertise, improved patient monitoring, increased participation and therapeutic adherence, better patient outcomes and patient empowerment. In this review, we discuss opportunities and key-barriers to improve application of digital health technologies in the field of autoimmune diseases. We also describe what could be the fully digital pathway of rCTD patients. Smart technologies can be used to provide real-world evidence about the natural history of rCTDs, to determine real-life drug utilization, advanced efficacy and safety data for rare diseases and highlight significant unmet needs. Yet, digitalization remains one of the most challenging issues faced by rCTD patients, their physicians and healthcare systems. Digital health technologies offer enormous potential to improve autoimmune rCTD care but this potential has so far been largely unrealized due to those significant obstacles. The need for robust assessments of the efficacy, affordability and scalability of AI in the context of digital health is crucial to improve the care of patients with rare autoimmune diseases.}

abstract = {Resilience is a widely debated concept that encompasses various interpretations and definitions. Recently, in science and policy circles, there has been a growing interest in the concept of Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) resilience which offers a new interpretation. While this concept is now used frequently, it is not properly understood and there is still a lack of clarity on what it means and its underpinning principles. This lack of clarity and understanding may confuse and even disorient researchers and policy makers. To address this issue, we review the literature published in the context of urban systems. The reviewed literature is mainly focused on nature-based solutions, indicating more contributions from the ecological field. Also, flooding, extreme heat, and drought are major stressors discussed in the literature. We elaborate on the definition of SETS resilience and discuss that its dominant principles are adaptability, transformability, flexibility, redundancy, equity, diversity, foresight capacity, connectivity, robustness, multi-functionality, learning, and non-linearity. We also expound upon the key components of SETS, how they are intertwined, and potential trade-offs that may emerge between them. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of the SETS approach leads to numerous ancillary benefits. These include benefits for climate change adaptation and mitigation, pandemic prevention and response, human health and well-being, and justice. If multi-level and polycentric governance strategies are adopted, it can also help avoid trade-offs that may emerge between social, ecological, and technological dimensions. We conclude by emphasizing that the literature is dominated by epistemological approaches and more empirical research is needed to understand better the complex dynamics of SETS resilience.}

Scientific research on the actual performance of BPI is rather recent and fragmented. Based on a coding scheme, we systematically analyse international empirical BPI studies published in 43 international peer-reviewed journal papers. We show that, so far, overall levels of BPI are low, reflected in too abstract targets, add-on biodiversity policies not targeting the driving forces of biodiversity loss, and insufficient resources made available to pursue biodiversity recovery. Joint planning processes, the revision of policies for consistent and coherent incentives, and adaptive learning are identified as central factors for improving BPI, but considerable barriers in these areas undermine progress in BPI. A change in institutional settings seems necessary to provide more favourable conditions for BPI, including the assignment of less voluntary responsibilities for biodiversity recovery.}

However, to what extent CPSs should be smarter so that they do not compromise safety and security of safety critical systems? is an open research question. Towards this goal, the purpose of this study is to establish a grounded theory to analyse what makes these systems smart? and eventually, how to find a balance between smartness and safety risks? In this precinct, this article aims to develop a conceptual framework, define the dimensions and derive the characteristics that make CPSs smart. The proposed approach combines an automated informetric and systematic analysis of literature pertinent to the topic of smartness across anthropology, science, engineering and technology.

This semi-systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of previous research on the planning, development, and evaluation of energy systems in sustainability-profiled districts in Sweden. The review of 70 journal and conference articles reveals seven research themes in the interdisciplinary nexus of energy systems and sustainability-profiled districts: (1) Conceptualizations and critique of sustainability-profiled districts, (2) Evaluations of energy goals and requirements, (3) Technical and economic assessments of heating and electricity systems, (4) Integration of innovative (energy) solutions in urban planning, (5) Stakeholder perspectives on energy systems, (6) Stakeholder collaboration on the building and the district level, (7) Governance and policy instruments for sustainable urban development and energy systems. We use a socio-technical ecology approach to critically discuss the existing research on energy systems planning, development, and evaluation to guide future research on energy systems development in urban districts. An increase in integrated approaches across all identified research themes and relationships between scales, phases, and impacts are discussed as central observations that can guide future research. Future research is needed on new or better-adapted energy indicators, the inclusion, perspectives, and roles of (new) stakeholders, and the consideration of ecology and nature in research on the planning, development, and evaluation of energy systems.}

abstract = {Since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, partnerships between actors from different sectors and countries have been joining forces to tackle major sustainability challenges. Within the textile and clothing industry, inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships have worked to address labor rights violations and environmentally harmful modes of production. Although research on these networks and partnerships has been increasing, it has remained heterogeneous. It derives from many different disciplines and research communities, leaving behind an opaque field of literature. This article provides a critical overview and a comprehensive understanding of research on inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships of the textile and clothing industry through a systematic literature review. It analyzes 301 academic peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2018. It uses quantitative full-text bibliometric word analysis, followed by coding around the meta-framework of modes of governance, which provides an integrative framework for this field of study. Firstly, this analysis revealed four discourses referred to as Economic and Industrial Development, Ecology and Environment, Private Labor Governance and Workers’ Rights, and Critical Ethnographies. Secondly, these four discourses were found to differ in their thematic sustainability challenges as well as in their variety of governance modes and partnerships. Research on economic sustainability tends to focus on modes of central and public-private governance; research on environmental challenges focus more on private governance of supply networks and; research on social sustainability tends to focus on more participatory, interactive and self-governing modes between multiple actors. The analysis provides a unique classification of scientific articles through modes of governance, which is helpful in positioning research in the debate, analyzing and comparing approaches and thus highlighting current gaps and opportunities for future research. The results indicate that both inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration is needed to address the identified dialectical and practical challenges, including increased involvement of research as a key actor in knowledge creation for governance and sustainability transformation within the textile and clothing industry.}

abstract = {Climate-smart forestry (CSF) is an emerging branch of sustainable adaptive forest management aimed at enhancing the potential of forests to adapt to and mitigate climate change. It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest managers in this new generation of forest monitoring.
La foresterie intelligente face au climat est une branche émergente de la gestion forestière adaptative et durable dont l’objectif est d’accroître la capacité des forêts de s’adapter au changement climatique et d’en atténuer les effets. Cela comporte beaucoup plus d’exigences en termes de données que la foresterie traditionnelle. Ces exigences en matière de données peuvent être satisfaites grâce à de nouveaux appareils qui permettent de surveiller la forêt in situ en continu et en temps réel. Nous proposons un réseau complet de capteurs, c.-à-d. un réseau de capteurs sans fil, qui peut faire partie d’un réseau mondial d’objets interconnectés individuellement adressables, un Internet des objets (IdO) qui peut rendre les données disponibles presque en temps réel à de nombreux intéressés, incluant des scientifiques, des forestiers et des gestionnaires forestiers, et qui peut en partie motiver les citoyens à participer à une importante collecte de données. L’utilisation de sources in situ de données de suivi comme données d’entraînement validées sur le terrain pour des données de télédétection peut favoriser la surveillance des forêts en augmentant les échelles spatiale et temporelle, permettant ainsi une meilleure compréhension des processus forestiers et des menaces potentielles. Certains des développements et applications clés de ces capteurs sont présentés dans cet article avec des directives pour la gestion des données. Des exemples de leur déploiement pour détecter les signaux d’alerte rapide des changements de régime des écosystèmes en ce qui a trait à la productivité, l’état de santé et la biodiversité de la forêt sont présentés. L’analyse de l’utilisation stratégique de ces outils met en évidence les occasions d’intéresser les citoyens et les gestionnaires forestiers à cette nouvelle génération de suivi des forêts.

The application of complex network analysis(CNA) in EI research is conducive to realizing more secure, economic and sustainable distributed renewable energy supply and utilization in cities, and to realizing energy conservation, emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement in low-carbon cities. Based on the development history of EI, this paper introduces regional energy internet(REI) from two aspects of research scope and main characteristics. At the same time, based on reviewing the graph theory(GT) and CNA’s application in energy-related domain, it summarizes the particularity of coupling interconnection between transportation network and social network in REI. The concept of energy self-organization(ESO) and energy community(EC) is introduced based on self-organization theory, meanwhile, the differences and advantages between ESO and previous similar concepts are summarized and compared. On this basis, the key issues of REI are analyzed from the perspective of ECs, including complex network topology modeling, optimal network flow allocation, coordination and complementary control, cascade failure mechanism(the scale of different failures can be enlarged through interdependence) analysis and multi-agent interest interaction game. Meanwhile, main research challenges are summarized and the future work is prospected. Finally, the paper conclude the work and deficiencies—it provides a theoretical basis for realizing a city’s collaborative optimization, independent autonomy and efficient low-carbon operation, and improves the application of CNA in urban REI research.}

abstract = {The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.}

abstract = {The home energy management (HEM) sector is going through an enormous change that includes important elements like incorporating green power, enhancing efficiency through forecasting and scheduling optimization techniques, employing smart grid infrastructure, and regulating the dynamics of optimal energy trading. As a result, ecosystem players need to clarify their roles, develop effective regulatory structures, and experiment with new business models. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading seems to be one of the viable options in these conditions, where consumers can sell/buy electricity to/from other users prior to totally depending on the utility. P2P energy trading enables the exchange of energy between consumers and prosumers, thus provide a more robust platform for energy trading. This strategy decentralizes the energy market more than it did previously, opening up new possibilities for improving energy trade between customers and utility. Considering above scenarios, this research provides an extensive insight of P2P energy trading structure, procedure, market design, trading platform, pricing mechanism, P2P approaches, forecasting techniques, scheduling topologies and possible futuristic techniques, while examining their characteristics, pros and cons with the primary goal of determining whichever approach is most appropriate in a given situation for P2P HEMs. Moreover, an optimal and robust P2P HEMs load scheduling framework simulation model is also proposed to analyze the P2P HEMs network critically, thus paving futuristic technical research directions for the scientific researchers. With this cooperation, a new age of technological advancements ushering in a more intelligent, more interconnected, and reactive urban environment are brought to life. In this sense, the path to smart living entails reinventing the urban environment as well as how people interact with and perceive their dwellings in the larger framework of a smart city. Finally, this research work also provides a comprehensive overview of technical challenges in P2P HEMs in terms of load forecasting and scheduling strategies, their possible solutions, and future prospects.}

By integrating the results from different disciplinary fields, ranging from material sciences to behavioural and social sciences, the article sheds light on the contestations between different sustainability goals and interests that relate to food packaging and it shows that there are trade-offs between them. With an in-depth analysis of the sustainability issues related to different phases of the life cycle of plastic food packages, the article identifies how the attempts to govern individual sustainability problems as part of circular economy policies create tensions with other sustainability issues. The analysis shows that while the circular economy covers the entire life cycle of a food package, the beginning and the end of the life cycle have gained the most attention and only limited number of policy measures focus on the consumption phase. As a conclusion, we claim that the different functions of plastic food packaging need to be acknowledged better in environmental policy design.}

Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.}

abstract = {Effective engineering asset management (EAM) is critical to economic development and improving livability in society, but its complexity often impedes optimal asset functionalities. Digital twins (DTs) could revolutionize the EAM paradigm by bidirectionally linking the physical and digital worlds in real time. There is great industrial and academic interest in DTs for EAM. However, previous review studies have predominately focused on technical aspects using limited life-cycle perspectives, failing to holistically synthesize DTs for EAM from the managerial point of view. Based on a systematic literature review, we introduce an analytical framework for describing DTs for EAM, which encompasses three levels or categories: DT 1.0 for technical EAM, DT 2.0 for technical−human EAM, and DT 3.0 for technical−environmental EAM. Using this framework, we identify what is known, what is unknown, and future directions at each level. DT 1.0 addresses issues of asset quality, progress, and cost management, generating technical value. It lacks multi-objective self-adaptive EAM, however, and suffers from high application cost. It is imperative to enable closed-loop EAM in order to provide various functional services with affordable DT 1.0. DT 2.0 accommodates issues of human−machine symbiosis, safety, and flexibility management, generating managerial value beyond the technical performance improvement of engineering assets. However, DT 2.0 currently lacks the automation and security of human−machine interactions and the managerial value related to humans is not prominent enough in it. Future research needs to align technical and managerial value with highly automated and secure DT 2.0. DT 3.0 covers issues of participatory governance, organization management, sustainable development, and resilience enhancement, generating macro social value. Yet it suffers from organizational fragmentation and can only address limited social governance issues. Numerous research opportunities exist to coordinate different stakeholders. Similarly, future research opportunities exist to develop DT 3.0 in a more open and complex system.}

These are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change, leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society, environment, and economy. The cross-sector Internet of Things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective, cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards. However, despite growing prominence within research, this technology remains under-utilised, in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology, obscuring the strategic co-ordination of research. We respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology, practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape, as well as identifying key research gaps for future development. We find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is, or will be, beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management, although this has not yet transferred to water quality. However, research is dominated by proof-of-concept modelling studies, with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets, individual pilot studies and monitoring. We recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated, decentralised, and optimised catchment-scale approach.}

The employment of internet of things (IoT) technologies has proven to be a valid response to mobility challenges in rural areas, and has brought up the concept of “smart land”. Framed within the context of the Interreg Central Europe project RUMOBIL, this study tries to shed light on how the deployment of smart mobility solutions within the rural context compare to that within the urban context. Following a literature review, we compared the ease of implementation of different IoT solutions on the urban and the rural contexts, for planners, travellers, and operators, and the relative complexity of common smart mobility issues. In addition, we identified three major challenges for both rural and urban mobility, namely the need for standardized metrics for optimal routes' detection and a dynamic definition of optimal route, as well as the simplification of investments' planning and programming. Both smart cities and smart land can benefit from smart mobility solutions, even if in most cases, each of the two contexts can gain more advantages than the other from the same solution. Even considering the different levels of population scattering, technological infrastructures, social maturity, and economic opportunities, both rural and urban areas offer comparable advantages. For the future of transport, it is up to all policy levels to consider the challenges deriving from expected trends and leverage the untapped potential of IoT technologies to satisfy future travellers’ needs and ensure sustainability.}

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) run on blockchain technology (BCT) to implement agreements between several parties. As BCT grows, organizations aim to automate their processes and engage in business collaborations using SCs. The translation of contract semantics into SC language semantics is difficult due to ambiguous contractual interpretation by the several parties and the developers. Also, an SC language itself misses the language constructs needed for semantically expressing collaboration terms. This leads to SC coding errors that result in contractual conflicts over transactions during the performance of SCs and thus, novel SC solutions incur high development and maintenance costs. Various model-based and no/low code development approaches address this issue by enabling higher abstractions in SC development. Still, the question remains unanswered how contractual parties, i.e., end-users with non-IT skills, manage to develop legally relevant SCs with ease. This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the state of the art of SC automation models, in terms of their technical features, and their legal significance, and to (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a systematic literature review (SLR) that follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham for performing SLRs in software-engineering. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 1367 papers are collected, and 33 of them are selected for extraction and analysis. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) 10 different SC automation models/frameworks are identified and classified according to their technical and implementation features; (2) 11 different legal contract parameters are identified and categorized into 4 legal criteria classes; (3) a comparative analysis of SC-automation models in the context of their legal significance is conducted that identifies the degrees to which the SC-automation models are considered legally relevant. As a conclusion, we produce a comprehensive and replicable overview of the state of the art of SC automation models and a systematic measure of their legal significance to benefit practitioners in the field.}

However, we still know very little about what to expect and how to cope with these changes based on scientific investigations from a behavioral and social perspective. To fill this void, this special issue “Smart technologies and urban life: A behavioral and social perspective” presents a collection of ten papers covering four themes, namely smart technologies-generated big data and urban research, smart technologies and travel behavior, smart technologies and energy consumption, and smart technologies and urban life. Specific topics include the application of open source data and deep learning techniques, the development of smart street lighting system, the usage and social implications of smartphone applications, the ownership and application of emerging mobility services, household decisions on investments in renewable energy equipment, travel behavior, smartness and sustainability etc. Building upon findings from these studies, we speculate on the prospects and future applications of smart technologies and their implications for social and environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {5G is the fifth generation wireless network, with a set of characteristics, such as high bandwidth and data rates, massive connectivity, broad coverage, and low latency. The scenarios of using 5G include enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), and ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC). 5G is expected to support a wide variety of applications, such as city management, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and energy management. In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping study that covers the literature published between January 2012 and December 2019 regarding using 5G in smart cities. The scenarios, architecture, technologies, challenges, and lessons learned of using 5G in smart cities are summarized and further analyzed based on 32 selected studies, and the results are that: (1) The studies are distributed over 27 publication venues. 17 studies report results based on academic studies and 13 studies use demonstration or toy examples. Only 2 studies report using 5G in smart cities based on industrial studies. 16 studies include assumptions of 5G network design or smart city scenarios. (2) The most discussed smart city scenario is transportation, followed by public safety, healthcare, city tourism, entertainment, and education. (3) 28 studies propose and/or discuss the architecture of 5G-enabled smart cities, containing smart city architecture (treating 5G as a component), 5G network architecture in smart cities, and business architecture of using 5G in smart cities. (4) The most mentioned 5G-related technologies are radio access technologies, network slicing, and edge computing. (5) Challenges are mainly about complex context, challenging requirements, and network development of using 5G in smart cities. (6) Most of the lessons learned identified are benefits regarding 5G itself or the proposed 5G-related methods in smart cities. This work provides a reflection of the past eight years of the state of the art on using 5G in smart cities, which can benefit both researchers and practitioners in this field.}

abstract = {Smart cities are aimed to efficiently manage growing urbanization, energy consumption, maintain a green environment, improve the economic and living standards of their citizens, and raise the people’s capabilities to efficiently use and adopt the modern information and communication technology (ICT). In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.}

abstract = {Adaptive management (AM) is widely promoted to improve management of natural resources, yet its implementation is challenging. We show that obstacles to the implementation of AM are related not only to the AM process per se but also to external factors such as ecosystem properties and governance systems. To overcome obstacles, there is a need to build capacities within the AM process by ensuring adequate resources, management tools, collaboration, and learning. Additionally, building capacities in the legal and institutional frames can enable the necessary flexibility in the governance system. Furthermore, in systems experiencing profound changes in wildlife populations, building such capacities may be even more critical as more flexibility will be needed to cope with increased uncertainty and changed environmental conditions.}

abstract = {To facilitate the personalized smart manufacturing paradigm with cognitive automation capabilities, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has attracted ever-increasing attention by offering an adaptive and flexible solution. DRL takes the advantages of both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), by embracing the power of representation learning, to make precise and fast decisions when facing dynamic and complex situations. Ever since the first paper of DRL was published in 2013, its applications have sprung up across the manufacturing field with exponential publication growth year by year. However, there still lacks any comprehensive review of the DRL in the field of smart manufacturing. To fill this gap, a systematic review process was conducted, with 261 relevant publications selected to date (20-Oct-2022), to gain a holistic understanding of the development, application, and challenges of DRL in smart manufacturing along the whole engineering lifecycle. First, the concept and development of DRL are summarized. Then, the typical DRL applications are analyzed in the four engineering lifecycle stages: design, manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance. Finally, the challenges and future directions are illustrated, especially emerging DRL-related technologies and solutions that can improve the manufacturing system’s deployment feasibility, cognitive capability, and learning efficiency, respectively. It is expected that this work can provide an insightful guide to the research of DRL in the smart manufacturing field and shed light on its future perspectives.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) bring new risks and safety benefits to future road transport. This paper explores the impacts and consequences of CAVs on the organizational, governance and knowledge practices of vehicle accident investigation (VAI). A focus on these practices of VAI draws attention to its politics, a key aspect behind accident investigations that receives little attention. We do so through three lines of inquiry. First, we read the accident investigation and safety science literature to list the characteristics of a state-of-the-art ideal-typical VAI organization. Second, we draw from the literature to identify seven challenging characteristics from CAVs to existing VAI designs and practices: automation, mixed traffic, connectivity (including cyber security), data, regulatory gaps, safety culture and international connections. Lastly, we describe the current state of affairs of VAI in the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States, highlighting differences and commonalities. In the conclusion, we bring these lines of inquiry together, conclude that there is a need for further governance work on VAI and CAVs, and list several avenues of future study.}
