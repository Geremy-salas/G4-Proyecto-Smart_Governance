abstract = {Purpose
This review aims to comprehensively analyze the Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) model, which connects local food producers directly with consumers. By exploring participation factors, sustainable practices, challenges, economic impacts, and social benefits, this study seeks to provide a thorough understanding of SFSCs. Addressing gaps in existing research, the review aims to guide policymakers and practitioners in fostering sustainable, resilient, and inclusive local food systems.
Design/methodology/approach
A systematic literature review of 92 research articles was conducted following a well-defined research protocol.
Findings
The review revealed that factors driving the adoption of SFSCs include increasing consumer demand for local and sustainable products, resilience-building in the food system, and environmental concerns. The SFSC supply chain was categorized into four critical stages: food sourcing and production, processing, aggregation, and distribution and review examined the sustainable practices at each stage. However, challenges such as information asymmetry, lack of infrastructure, regulatory barriers, and market dynamics hinder the full potential of SFSCs. Economically, SFSCs contribute to local economic development and empowerment of small-scale producers, while also showing promise in reducing environmental footprints and fostering community engagement.
Research implications
The study identifies several research avenues to further advance the understanding of SFSCs. Future research should delve into consumer behavior and attitudes towards SFSCs, analyze the full sustainability impacts of SFSCs using integrated assessment methodologies, and extend the study to different regional contexts. Additionally, investigating policy interventions and governance mechanisms that can support the growth and resilience of SFSCs will be crucial for promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
Originality/value
This review contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and systematic overview of SFSCs, addressing gaps left by previous review studies. The study's findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders seeking to enhance the adoption and support of SFSCs in contemporary food systems.}

abstract = {Collaborative networks (CNs) are joint entities of autonomous partners that work towards a common goal with shared resources and roles. In 2016, the United Nations announced 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) as part of the 2030 agenda. SDG 17 is “Partnerships for the goals” highlighting the importance of cross-country and cross-company collaborative action. Although the link between CNs and sustainable development is frequently declared, no study in the literature investigates the connection between CNs and the SDGs. This systematic literature review (SLR) follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the SLR results, a context-interventions-mechanisms-outcomes (CIMO) framework for CNs is proposed, serving as a tool to comprehend the types of CNs to achieve the SDGs. Only 10 out of 77 articles mentioned the SDGs they address. The norm is to focus on a single SDG per study and not assess the dimension of the impact on the SDGs or the trade-offs that can be established between them. The most frequently mentioned SDGs in the text are SDG 9 and SDG 12, with only 2 articles focusing on the social dimension. SDG 10 and SDG 16 were not mentioned in any of the articles. The majority of articles are case studies and technical papers, developing scale-up solutions and creating value from waste. The identified gaps lead to the proposition of several potential research areas: 1) the need for developing mechanisms that allow CNs to effectively implement interventions that achieve specific SDGs; 2) the lack of studies incorporating the social dimension given the social nature of the SDGs; 3) few SDGs are addressed by CNs (particularly SDG 9 and SDG 12) and majority of SDGs are ignored; 4) there is a scarcity of studies targeting the tertiary sector; 5) the need for alignment of CNs' business models with the SDGs; 6) a lack of studies addressing specific SDGs (6, 10, and 16); and 7) the necessity of studies demonstrating collaboration between industry and academia for systemic change. The study aids decision-makers in identifying policies that facilitate the formation of CNs aligned with the SDGs.}

Agricultural Energy Internet, an important extension of Energy Internet in the agricultural field, significantly contributes to agricultural modernization. Key technologies of Agricultural Energy Internet are vital factors supporting its development. This article systematically reviews the key technologies of Agricultural Energy Internet for two areas: agriculture and fishery. The working mechanisms and power consumption characteristics of some state-of-the-art new-energy agricultural intelligent equipment are described. In addition, the principles and profit methods underlying the agro-industrial complementary operation model are introduced. Moreover, against the Agricultural Energy Internet background, the development trends of some state-of-the-art new energy agricultural intelligent equipment, agro-industrial complementary, and carbon–neutral technology are proposed in this paper, providing novel perspectives on the promotion of the development of Agricultural Energy Internet and related technological innovation research. An unmanned farm is the main form of the future agricultural system, which is powered by the Agricultural Energy Internet based on smart agriculture and a smart grid. It will become the inevitable trend of modern agriculture to replace oil agriculture with electric farms. The electricity in farming is mainly generated by renewable energy. Renewable energy power generation has low carbon emissions and is the future direction for the development of agricultural energy systems. In addition, the Internet of Things will be further strengthened to realize automation and intelligence of agricultural energy systems.}

abstract = {The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing ‘planetary public health’. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.}

Second, the unique characteristics of nature-based living labs are identified using a systematic literature review. Finally, the core characteristics of living labs are determined, and nature-based living labs are placed within this context. Initial living labs had a strong technological focus, which proliferated into diverse application domains and regions after the European Network of Living Labs was established and expanded. Urban living labs emerged as a significant multidisciplinary and geographically specific domain, while nature-based living labs are inherently sustainability-oriented and consider ecosystem processes, interactions, and natural materials. Next, the paper identifies nine characteristics of nature-based living labs, five of which are always present, namely: (i) real-life spatial context and multi-scale, (ii) innovation and learning, (iii) user-centric, (iv) multi-actor involvement and (v) sustainability-oriented multiple benefits. Then, the four core characteristics of living labs, the variation within these characteristics, and how these align with the characteristics of nature-based living labs are clarified. Finally, the need for research on living labs across application domains and regions is highlighted, so that the global applicability of these local, user-centric, innovative approaches can be established.}

The findings show that extant literature is skewed towards the prevalence of technological issues and highlights the relatively lower focus on other themes, such as contextual knowledge co-creation issues, conceptualisation, and application domains. While there have been increasing technological issues with artificial intelligence, the three identified areas of security concern are data security, model security and network security. Furthermore, the review found that contemporary AI, which continually drives the boundaries of computational capabilities to tackle increasingly intricate decision-making challenges, distinguishes itself from earlier iterations in two primary aspects that significantly affect organisational learning in dealing with AI's potential: autonomy and learnability. This study contributes to AI research by providing insights into current issues, research methodology, level of analysis and conceptual approaches, and AI framework to help identify research gaps for future investigations.}

abstract = {Faced with the rapid increase in smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and the high demand for new business-oriented services in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond network, the management of mobile networks is getting complex. Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks. Finally, several lessons learned from the literature and open research problems related to ZSM realization are also discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {With Green Deals and a competitive techno-economic basis for low-carbon energy transitions, energy infrastructural change is intensifying. This is matched by rapid growth in scholarship on sociotechnical transitions and energy justice, combined in the phrase ‘just transitions’. Yet how can an abstract concern with a normative concept like justice be brought to bear on the socio-technical complexities of specific changes in energy infrastructure? This is an important and timely question to consider in a practical sense, since the energy policy landscape is increasingly focused on a ‘just transition’ as combining decarbonisation and a progressive vision of social equity and justice. Our synthesis review argues that a focus on the alleviation of energy poverty – a condition whereby people are unable to secure adequate levels of energy services in the home – can enable policy-oriented mobilisation of energy justice as an integral component of evolving energy infrastructure. We approach energy poverty as an opportunity to constructively broach issues of justice in global energy policy discourse, not as a catch-all for wider injustices and vulnerabilities. We present a conceptual framework, applied to three schematic cases of energy infrastructure under transition. In and across these cross-sectoral cases, we reflect on scope for energy poverty alleviation.}

Blockchain’s unique recording capabilities make the existing clearing and settlement process redundant. Banks and other financial entities are adopting blockchain-enabled IDs to identify people. Better results come from organisations’ capacity to foresee emerging trends in financial blockchain applications and develop blockchain functionality. The transfer of asset ownership and addressing the maintenance of a precise financial ledger. Measurement, communication, and analysis of financial information are three significant areas to be focussed on by accounting professionals. Blockchain clarifies asset ownership and the existence of obligations for accountants, and it has the potential to improve productivity. This paper identifies and studies relevant articles related to blockchain for finance. This paper focuses on Blockchain technology and its importance for financial services. Further takes up various tools, strategies, and featured services in Blockchain-based financial services. Finally, the paper identifies and evaluates the significant applications of Blockchain technology in financial services. Credit reports significantly impact the financial lives of customers. Recent data breaches demonstrate the superior security of blockchain-based credit reporting over conventional server-based reporting. Blockchain-based systems enable the faster, more cost-effective, and more customised issuance of digital securities. With its adoption, the market for investors can be expanded, costs for issuers can be reduced, and counterparty risk can be reduced due to the ability to customise digital financial instruments to the demands of investors. It uses mutualised standards, protocols, and shared procedures to give network users a single common source of truth.

As this topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines, there is a need to synthesize and categorize these diverse contributions to inspire future investigations of emerging or under-researched substantive areas. This article addresses this need by reviewing existing research on supply chain transparency and offers an integrated understanding of this growing literature. By analyzing a sample of over 300 peer-reviewed articles through bibliometric and automated text mining methods, we identify six distinct clusters that represent substantive literature subdomains: transparency technologies, knowledge integration, governance, sustainability, traceability, and resilience. Building on these structured analyses, we develop a literature framework to comprehensively organize insights from these clusters and illustrate the conceptual relationships between transparency management systems, transparency vehicles, and transparency outcomes. By providing a holistic examination of how supply chain transparency is enabled, our framework aids researchers' future studies and guides practitioners’ strategies to identify, diagnose, and address modern challenges that face supply chains (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, workplace exploitation, increased third-party scrutiny).}

In recent years, policymakers, international energy, and environmental organizations have posited that advancements in information and communication technology, digitalization, renewable energy, and financial development can facilitate a smoother and quicker transition toward a greener and smarter global economy. This study employs the Panel Vector Auto-Regression model to evaluate this assertion across the top ten most polluted countries from 1995 to 2018. The empirical findings indicate that while individual indicators of information and communication technology have mixed impacts, the utilization of a digitalization-based principal component analysis index provides strong evidence of digitalization's positive effect on environmental quality. Additionally, the results suggest that renewable energy and the economic complexity index also contribute to environmental improvement. Therefore, the empirical evidence underscores the significant role of digitalization, information and communication technology, and renewable energy in enhancing environmental sustainability in the most polluted countries. Moreover, the findings indicate that although a financial development shock initially worsens environmental quality in the first year, it leads to improvements from the second year onwards. These empirical insights offer various policy recommendations regarding information and communication technology, digitalization, renewable energy, and financial development, which could support the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.}

abstract = {To ensure access towards an affordable and clean energy for all, the Malaysian government has tabled the National Energy Policy in 2022 which further addresses the energy trilemma challenges and investment objectives on environmental, social and governance (ESG) core values. While Malaysia sets its target to achieve 18 % of total primary supply only relying on renewable energy sources, it is expected that there will be an energy mismatch between supply and demand within the network due to the stochastic behavior of weather dependent renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar PV. Hence, energy storage system (ESS) delivers a better solution with its capability to perform power regulation or as a storage unit to manage with the intermittent generation from existing renewable sources. Therefore, this review outlines the prospect and outlook of first and second life lithium-ion energy storage in different applications within the distribution grid system which aligns with the policies present in Malaysia. This paper also highlights both technical and non-technical reviews on both energy storage technologies. Evidently, the outcome of the paper shows that the application of energy storage exhibits better performance along with the integration of renewable energy sources as compared to the present technology in the Malaysian grid system. In addition, second-life lithium-ion batteries with 80 % of remaining capacity could potentially elevate the present economic value of ESS within its service lifetime.}

Conventional routes for drug delivery are oral, buccal, rectal, subcutaneous, intranasal, intramuscular, intravenous, pulmonary and transdermal. These are the commonly used methods for treatment of various medical problems but have certain limitations such as instability, risk of displacement, uncontrolled release, side effect such as irritation and pain, slow absorption, enzymatic deterioration and many others. Incorporation of drug into nanocarrier is one of the efficient methods for targeted and sustained delivery of drug. Applications of nanocarriers such as solid nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, virus like nanoparticles, carbon nanotube and mesoporous silica nanoparticles are discussed in this review. To overcome drawbacks of drug delivery, innovative delivery systems are designed usually termed as smart drug delivery systems which include nucleic acid-based drug delivery system, cell-based drug delivery system, self-nano emulsifying drug delivery system, self-micro emulsifying drug delivery system, chemical and physical stimuli-based drug delivery system, nanoneedles, patches, ultrasound drug delivery and microchip technology.

Twenty-two indicators, termed the Energy Security Indicators for Pakistan (ESIP), were selected. The ESIP were normalised using the z-score method and weighted based on principal component analysis (PCA). The index analysis revealed that Pakistan's energy security performance decreased between 1991 and 1999, followed by an increase until 2018. A maximum score of 8.36 was attained in 1991, and a minimum of 7.59 was achieved in 1999. During 2000–2018, the performance improved, resulting in a score of 8.29 in 2018. Supply, consumption, and import indicators played a key role in the energy security performance in the studied period.}

Projected climate change impacts will aggravate water availability, as well as flood risks, especially in urban areas. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been identified as key concepts to defuse the expected tensions within the Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus due to their multiple benefits. In this paper, the authors outlined the theories and concepts, analyzed real-life case studies, and discussed the potential of NBS to address the future W-E-F nexus. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review on the theories of NBS that address the W-E-F nexus, and we summarized 19 representative real-life case studies to identify the current knowledge gaps and challenges. The quantitative and qualitative data was used to differentiate and discuss the direct and indirect potential benefits of NBS to the W-E-F nexus. The study further expanded on the challenges for the implementation of NBS and highlighted the growing possibilities in the context of circularity and the implementation of NBS in urban planning. It was concluded that the potential impacts of NBS on the W-E-F nexus have been identified, but the quantitative effects have not been analyzed in-depth. Moreover, indicators are mostly single-purpose and not multipurpose, as required to fully characterize the W-E-F nexus and circularity holistically. Overall, there is a need to adopt systemic thinking and promote the multipurpose design of NBS.}

abstract = {There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of “financialisation” to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive “business models”, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.}

The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.}

abstract = {In order to provide a coherent overview of cyber security research, the Scopus academic abstract and citation database was mined to create a citation graph of 98,373 authors active in the field between 1949 and early 2020. The Louvain community detection algorithm was applied to the graph in order to identify existing research communities. The analysis discovered twelve top-level communities: access control, authentication, biometrics, cryptography (I & II), cyber–physical systems, information hiding, intrusion detection, malwares, quantum cryptography, sensor networks, and usable security. These top-level communities were in turn composed of a total of 80 sub-communities. The analysis results are presented for each community in descriptive text, sub-community graphs, and tables with, for example, the most-cited papers and authors. A comparison between the detected communities and topical areas defined by other related work, is also presented, demonstrating a greater researcher emphasis on cryptography, quantum cryptography, information hiding and biometrics, at the expense of laws and regulation, risk management and governance, and security software lifecycle.}

abstract = {The unprecedented scale and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, and the accompanying lockdown implemented across many countries, has exacerbated water scarcity and security globally. Many European governments have introduced policy interventions to mitigate and protect their economies. Yet, water resources, which are a potential enabler in revitalising Europe's economy, have received few of such policy interventions since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency only in January 2020. Our scoping review of preliminary government responses of 27 European countries revealed that only 11 (40.7%) of these countries implemented at least one policy intervention that considered the water sector. These interventions were typically short-term measures involving either full cost absorption or deferment of water bills. Much attention on water governance and management processes, policies and financial investments required to augment the resilience of the water sector amid a growing scarcity of freshwater, triggered by extreme climate variation and also by COVID-19 pandemic should therefore be central to post COVID-19 recovery efforts in Europe. This paper also proposes future research directions, including a study that will harmonise water demand and consumption trends during the pandemic in Europe and an assessment on how the water sector can withstand possible external shocks in future.}

Therefore, this study has conducted a comprehensive literature review for six years (2017–2022) on the convergence of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger (Blockchain) technologies for supporting Dataspace integration efforts at the Edge. As an outcome, this study has identified relevant challenges that include heterogeneity, integration and interoperability, distributed security, trust, scalability, and resource management. It has also been found that very limited research covers the architectural aspects of distributed edge in the context of the convergence of technologies for Dataspace integration purposes. Therefore, this study has proposed an architectural framework – Distributed Edge Network Operations-oriented Semantic (DENOS) model that extends the traditional Cloud–Edge-Device architecture with three new layers – Semantic, Convergence, and Dataspace integration. In addition, the model leverages the power of semantic modelling (i.e., Processing, Service, and Data) context, which enables the model to have a dynamic implementation context to suit the diverse needs of target use cases. To showcase the validation of the model, a use case related to the digital traceable operation of the wind energy domain has been presented. The objective of the DENOS model is to enable Dataspace integration to build edge-enabled value chain networks. Thus, it contributes to secure and semantic integration using the convergence of resources and technologies, cross-domain collaboration, reusability and data-driven decision-making of resources.}

abstract = {A widely considered climate change mitigation strategy in agriculture is enhancing soil carbon (C) sequestration—the process of capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in the soil. By adopting natural climate solutions (NCS) such as cover crops, reduced tillage, and diverse crop rotations, farmers can increase soil C sequestration and co-benefits such as improved biodiversity. Canada is increasingly interested in better positioning farmers to adopt NCS via government cost-share programs, ecosystem marketplaces, and outreach and education initiatives. Given the policy and market-driven interest in soil C sequestration in agriculture, there is a need to advance the science–policy interface, ensuring foundational science, NCS implementation, and approaches to promote NCS are aligned. Herein, the objective is to present insights from multiple disciplines that can help build connections between soil C sequestration science and policy relevant to Canada's croplands. The method is a review of literature on soil and pedoclimate science, agricultural NCS adoption, agricultural NCS governance, and science–policy interfaces to achieve this objective. From this review, key insights underline that Canadian cropland soils do not have a homogenous history in NCS adoption and production type, nor are all regions influenced by the same contextual factors, have the same potential in C storage, or exist within the same agri-environmental conditions. Therefore, it is emphasized herein that policies that aim to enhance soil organic C in croplands should consider local context and C sequestration potential. Policies and programs implemented locally to enhance C sequestration across Canada should be complemented by nationally scalable measuring and monitoring to ensure outcomes are accounted for against climate goals. This review aims to contribute to building a common understanding of soil C sequestration in Canada's croplands and its science–policy interface. Efforts to further strengthen the science–policy interface for soil C sequestration in Canada's croplands might include greater integration and utilization of science and data from multiple disciplines, co-design and collaborative opportunities, and establishing on-the-ground test projects to explore innovation in policy and market design.}

Ports, as important hubs and sources of emissions have also received much attention. This paper investigated the development process of port emission reduction from earlier ‘environmental factors and energy scheduling’ to ‘low-carbon and green ports’ by conducting a systematic review and Citespace visual analysis. It can be also concluded that the policy has a great impact on the development of this research field. Meanwhile, this review found that among the emission reduction measures for ships in port, the average percentage of the energy measures potential is 25%–70%. The range of optimization operation measures is 30%–50%. There is a gap between the two measures. According to the diverse emission sources in the port, there is no significant difference (20%–60%) for the potential of measures application in land area. Therefore, before setting the reduction targets, ports need to know their emission level and establish emission inventories, as well as consider external factors (policy, economy, technology, etc.). Overall, port energy measures are the key points to achieving low and zero carbon targets. In the future, by addressing technical bottlenecks in energy use (such as hydrogen storage and maintenance), ports and ships will be able to further reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and increase their potential to reduce emissions. This paper aims to systematically review and explore the effects (experiences) and problems (challenges) of the abatement measures taken by different ports, to help low-abatement capacity ports to learn and find the measures that suit the emission reduction development most. For the choice of future energy, the port needs to analyze the corresponding policy factors and improve the abatement capacity through the integration of multiple measures, to understand the ‘zero carbon goal’ as soon as possible and make contributions to the environmental protection and ecological development of the region and world.}

As outlined in several public reports (e.g. from ECHA-European Chemical Agency and EFSA-European Food Safety Authority), the way forward in the coming years in Europe is to integrate New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) (including omics technologies) into hazard and hence risk assessment (RA). Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) describe a sequence of events in response to stress, from the molecular initiating event until an adverse outcome, which is relevant to RA or regulatory decision-making. AOPs are one of the facilitators to integrate mechanistic data into RA, but it is urgent to increase the inclusion of the vast mechanistic knowledge available, especially for the RA of novel smart and advanced materials (AdMa) with multifunctional characteristics. There are still many challenges to the routine usage of NAMs, e.g. omics-based information. Here, we summarise the current state of the art of ST, the benefits of human and environmental health cross knowledge and the available methods and output. The importance of this area has been highlighted for many years but is even more pressing in the context of AdMa. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and suggest recommendations for future implementation.}

However, there exist many unreasonable designs, configurations, and implementations of Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IndAI) in practice before achieving either Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0 vision, and a significant gap between the individualized requirement and actual implementation result still exists. To provide insights for designing appropriate models and algorithms in the upgrading process of the industry, this perspective article classifies IndAI by rating the intelligence levels and presents four principles of implementing IndAI. Three significant opportunities of IndAI, namely, collaborative intelligence, self-learning intelligence, and crowd intelligence, towards Industry 5.0 vision are identified to promote the transition from a technology-driven initiative in Industry 4.0 to the coexistence and interplay of Industry 4.0 and a value-oriented proposition in Industry 5.0. Then, pathways for implementing IndAI towards Industry 5.0 together with key empowering techniques are discussed.

This novel, comprehensive knowledge synthesis addresses issue of interest across multiple disciplines. Our review of concepts of urban development should be of particular value to researchers and practitioners in the health sciences, while our review of the links between urban environments and health should be of particular interest to those outside of public health. We identify specific actions to promote health through sustainable urban development that leaves no one behind, including: integrated planning; evidence-informed policy-making; and monitoring the implementation of policies.

Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated.

The study analyzed 66 relevant primary studies addressing sustainable activities, engagement approaches, and ICT solutions to promote and strengthen awareness of sustainable behavior and activities. The results indicate a growing interest among researchers in ICT-driven engagement approaches for sustainable choices. The study highlights the need for a blended approach that encompasses techno-social strategies to stimulate awareness of sustainable activities and practices at both individual and societal levels. Furthermore, there is a need for future research on the roles of policies, civic actions, and implementation framing, such as green identity, eco-subsidies, and green taxes, for effective strategies to design sustainability-centric technological solutions to foster citizen sustainability awareness and adoption of sustainable practices.

abstract = {Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize forestry by providing a secure and transparent method of tracking and verifying the origin and movement of forest products. This could help combat forestry issues such as illegal logging, deforestation, and label fraud. In this study, transparency, and the associated certification of sustainable forest management, as well as proof of legality of raw material is investigated. The adoption of blockchain technology in forestry is still in its infancy, and challenges include ensuring the accuracy of the data stored in the blockchain and the participation of all relevant stakeholders in the supply chain. Overall, blockchain technology offers great potential for successful deployment in the timber supply chain and could help promote sustainability and preserve biodiversity. This paper provides an overview of blockchain technology, considers requirements for forestry and timber industries, discusses necessary digitization aspects and refers to existing applications.}

The literature provides several examples showing how ML can be employed in most steps of a typical ERA.A key observation is that there are currently no clear guidance for using such autonomous technologies in ERAs or which standards/checks are required. Steering thus seems to be the most important task for supporting the use of ML in the ERA of nano- and smart-materials. Resources should be devoted to developing a strategy for implementing ML in ERA with a strong emphasis on data foundations, methodologies, and the related sensitivities/uncertainties. We should recognise historical errors and biases (e.g., in data) to avoid embedding them during ML programming.}

Already over half of the global population resides in cities, making the urban landscape a crucial focus area. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are an opportunity to address both environmental and societal challenges in both the immediate and long term, bearing particular importance in urban landscapes, as these pose more challenges and more opportunities for greater impact simultaneously. For the successful, widespread and sustainable implementation of NbS, wider inclusion of people and employment of deeper levels of participation are crucial. This review paper aimed to examine the relationship between participation and its various applications to NbS from global literature, and more specifically, assessing the levels of participation. We used Arnstein’s (Arnstein, 1969) ladder of participation to base our analysis against five essential criteria for participatory implementation. Our results demonstrate that ‘consultation’ and ‘partnership’ are the dominant levels of participation, while there is evidence supporting the adoption of deeper levels such as delegated power and citizen control. Our study argues that the role of landscape architects and urban planners should go beyond the role of experts towards facilitators and motivators, to enable wider and deeper participation of communities in defining their futures. The study contributes to the field by highlighting the potential and importance of participatory approaches, providing insights into a range of tools used to facilitate participation at various depths and offering practical and employable knowledge of application. We conclude by suggesting future pathways for empirical research.}

Countries in the BCLME region have responded to international calls to develop national climate change policies, adaptation strategies and plans to respond to these threats. These high-level documents recognize the need to better understand the vulnerabilities facing poor and marginalized communities in high risk areas and develop adaptive capacity to build resilience. However, small-scale fisheries are seldom explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, there is very little guidance on how vulnerability assessments should be conducted and how this information could inform adaptation planning. This paper reports on a community based, participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment methodology that was developed, tested and then applied in 15 communities in the BCLME region. The outcomes of these vulnerability assessments were then used to inform the development of local adaptation plans in five of these communities. Key findings from these local vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning processes are then presented. The discussion centers on the value, benefits and limitations of the participatory and rapid vulnerability assessment process, the need to take a holistic approach to understanding vulnerability, the ongoing and iterative nature of adaptation planning, the power of partnerships and networks, and the need to integrate community-based plans into other sector and climate change adaptation strategies and plans at all levels of governance.}

This review compares the adaptation of policies introduced by Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Ireland to investigate how the roles of community stakeholders interconnect with the European Union's commitment to accelerate onshore wind deployment. These mature markets view onshore wind energy as an essential contribution towards the net-zero electricity system, security of supply, and energy independence. The comparative case study highlights that the interaction between market-based and community-based approaches to wind energy development has seen the size, scale and formality of financial benefits increase while supports for small-scale community-led wind energy have been considerably reduced. The continued paradigm shift narrows the scope for community participation in wind farms and presents considerations and paradoxes regarding the role of communities in local energy transitions. Recommendations consider the need for flexibility regarding the geographic “proximity criteria” for citizen participation, approaches to include communities into the governance and disbursement of shared benefits, and the potential to encourage citizen investment into onshore wind energy. These contribute to the debate regarding the balance between objectives of the energy transition: to promote meaningful citizen participation and benefit at a local scale while rapidly reducing the levelized cost of renewable energy for the wider benefit of society.}

Although the circular ecosystem represents a promising initial bridge between the circular economy literature and the business ecosystem literature, studies remain largely descriptive with a conflictive and imprecise theoretical understanding of what a circular ecosystem is and its unique features. Consequently, the literature on circular ecosystems may tend to diverge due to a proliferation of definitions, rendering the accumulation of knowledge more difficult. To address this gap, we investigate how circular ecosystems are organized and the essential elements incorporated into this type of collaborative structure. Through a systematic literature review, we present the evolution of research over time and provide a framework that synthesizes the five main and unique elements of a circular ecosystem (1. Value, 2. Actors, 3. Data, Materials and flows, 4. Circular activities and strategies, and 5. Governance). In particular, the results show that a value proposition that allows multiple cycles of value (e.g. activities that ensure materials continually returning to the industrial system) is a critical aspect of the ecosystem. Also, the actors within this structure should be balanced to ensure that the circular activities are being successfully performed. The proposed framework serves to characterize a circular ecosystem and to provide unique features that distinguish it from non-circular ecosystems. In addition, this conceptual and strategic tool helps researchers to understand how this type of structure creates and captures value and allows companies to identify ecosystem partners and enhance their circular initiatives. Finally, we summarize the opportunities for future studies.}

Yet, in the practical implementation of Digital Twin projects, several issues persist: ① How to formulate reasonable task objectives and action plans before project implementation? ② how to determine and assess the development level of the digital twin during project implementation? ③ How to evaluate the effectiveness of digital twin after project completion and how to enhance improvement in the next steps? Consequently, a methodological model is urgently needed to evaluate the development process of Digital Twins, offering a benchmark for their design, development, and appraisal. To address these issues, this paper introduces a five-level Digital Twin Maturity Model (DTMM), which systematically aligns DT capabilities, phased objectives, and technical requirements within a unified framework, creating a theoretical system capable of assessing DT’s developmental level and specifying its construction trajectory. Further, this paper catalogs supporting tools aligned with the technical specifications stipulated in DTMM’s functional capabilities, aiding developers in devising implementation strategies. Additionally, it scrutinizes the application status across six DT vertical sectors, conducts maturity evaluations, and confirms the efficacy of the proposed model. The conclusion can be drawn that DT is still in its embryonic phase. This work aspires to assist project managers and public policymakers gain a more objective understanding of Digital Twin, offering references to facilitate their positive development and broader implementation.}

abstract = {Background
Competing priorities make using a transparent and evidence-based approach important when deciding to recommend new vaccines. We conducted a literature review to document the processes and frameworks for national decision-making on new vaccine introductions and explored which key features have evolved since 2010.
Methods
We searched literature published on policymaking related to vaccine introduction from March 2010 to August 2020 in six databases. We screened articles for eligibility with the following exclusion criteria: non-human or hypothetical vaccines, the sole focus on economic evaluation or decision to adopt rather than policy decision-making. We employed nine broad categories of criteria from the 2012 review for categorization and abstracted data on the country, income level, vaccine, and other relevant criteria.
Results
Of the 3808 unique references screened, 116 met eligibility criteria and were classified as: a) framework of vaccine adoption decision-making (27), b) studies that analyse empirical data on or examples of vaccine adoption decision-making (45), c) theoretical and empirical articles that provide insights into the vaccine policymaking process (44 + 17 already included in the previous categories). Commonly reported criteria for decision-making were the burden of disease; vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, safety; impact on health and non-health outcomes; economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions. Programmatic and acceptability aspects were not as often considered. Most (50; 82%) of the 61 articles describing the process of vaccine introduction policymaking highlighted the role of country, regional, or global evidence-informed recommendations and a robust national governance as enabling factors for vaccine adoption.
Conclusions
The literature on vaccine adoption decision-making has expanded since 2010. We found that policymakers and expert advisory committee members (e.g., National Immunization Technical Advisory Group [NITAG]) increasingly value the interventions based on economic evaluations. The results of this review could guide discussions on evidence-informed immunization decision-making among country, sub-regional, and regional stakeholders.}

abstract = {Electricity propels economic development through improvement in the quality of life. Even though government's strategy to increase power generation and supply exists, Uganda experiences regular power outages and has one of the lowest electrification rates in the world. This study employs a systematic review approach and extends securitisation theory to the electricity sector to characterise electricity security and assess its barriers in Uganda. In this context, five dimensions of electricity security are identified and compared. Based on this set of dimensions, results show that Uganda is electricity “insecure.” Further, six (6) barriers to electricity security in Uganda are identified, and each of them is assessed as either existential, potential, or both. Thus, interventions that alleviate or mitigate these barriers can improve Uganda's electricity security. A quantitative empirical analysis using longitudinal data could offer superior evidence and conclusion on electricity security in Uganda.}

This paper reviews the key information and communication technologies that are necessary to build an effective industrial energy management system considering the intermittence of renewable sources like wind and solar †. In particular, we first introduce the concept of software-defined energy networks in the context of industrial cyber-physical systems aiming at the optimal energy resource allocation in terms of its environmental impact. The task is formulated as a dynamic scheduling problem where supply and demand must match at minute-level timescale, also considering energy storage units. The use of (explainable and trustworthy) artificial intelligence (AI), (informative) networked data, demand-side management, machine-type (wireless) communications, and energy-aware scheduling in industrial plants are explored in detail. The paper also provides a framework for understanding the complexities of managing renewable energy sources in industrial plants while maintaining efficiency and environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {Agriculture has both witnessed and caused climate change. Therefore, building climate resilience in the food production system is mandatory. Currently in Sri Lanka, recommended climate-smart agricultural practices recommend a common package to the entire country. However, considering the diversity that occurs across the country in every social, and ecological aspect it is essential to understand the cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of the country to determine more efficient agricultural practices to improve the resilience of the agricultural systems in a particular region. To achieve this objective, numerous traditional methods can be employed in modern farming strategies in order to make it more nature-friendly. Therefore, this literature review was developed to provide insights for the development of an evidence-based framework to enhance the climate resilience of Sri Lanka's agricultural systems. In that aspect, 36 scientific communications were considered over 13 years, using articles from the Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases (2010–2023). In addition, 4 country papers, and publications from the UN, ADB, FAO, and IPCC were cited. In this literature review article, the relationship between agriculture and climate change was identified. Then, the climate-resilient ability of traditional agriculture and its location specificity were reviewed. The status of climate resilience in the existing food system was analyzed considering the Batticaloa farming system as a case study. Finally, an appropriate location-specific framework was suggested to build climate resilience by integrating traditional farming techniques into modern agriculture. As per the results, rainwater harvesting strategies as cascade village tank system, management of limited water through practices as shared cultivation (Bethma govithena), shared responsibility (Pangukariya) for the maintenance of village tanks, dry seed paddy farming (Kekulam govithena), maintaining agro-biodiversity via, mixed cropping, agro-forestry, use of resistant crop varieties are the key Sri Lankan traditional agricultural practices which can be adapted to build the system resilience. These practices are developed based on the specific cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of each region of the country. However, the establishment of micro-irrigation systems, utilizing early warning systems, development of high-yielding resistant crop varieties, crop-livestock integration, and cultivation of location-specific crop varieties are the main modern agricultural practices recommended to build up the climate resilience of the food systems. However, many of these recommended practices were exercised during the traditional agricultural systems as well. There are many other specific practices available that can be applied with modification even for present-day agriculture to enhance its climate resilience. Integrating the knowledge from traditional agriculture into modern agricultural practices will directly facilitate the achievement of three sustainable development goals of climate action, zero hunger, and no poverty through the development of regional-specific sustainable agricultural practices that restore the resilience of agriculture. Therefore, this literature review article proposes a framework for managing location-specific climate-resilient food systems on par with the regional agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of Sri Lanka.}

Despite this acknowledgement, the current literature lacks an overarching conceptual framework for understanding energy citizenship. This study employs a hybrid methodology, merging systematic and integrative literature reviews. The objective is to explain how existing studies conceptualise energy citizenship, outlining key dimensions and drivers in the literature. The findings reveal that drivers of energy citizenship span socio-political, economic, environmental, psychological, and ethical dimensions.}

The different types of Power Distribution System Planning (PDSP) can be classified as follows: Asset plan, Network plan, Process plan, Energy plan, Data plan, Facility plan, Economic plan, Regulation plan, and Customer relation plan. These classifications effectively demonstrate the influential factors, conditions, and objectives of PDSP. Furthermore, this paper investigates the management strategies for different PDSP classifications. Within each classification, we list and categorize relevant studies. By utilizing the framework proposed in this paper, readers can gain a comprehensive understanding of PDSP planning measures and make more optimal decisions within power distribution companies. Additionally, this paper identifies research gaps and presents a roadmap for future PDSP studies. Based on the findings of this paper, it is evident that the majority of research in this field has focused on expansion, while process-related studies have received relatively less attention.

The (sub)-national motivation to engage in REDD+ programs evolved over time. We reviewed literature on the underlying values and moral roots in subnational REDD+ implementation in two Southeast Asian countries with different political histories: Vietnam and Indonesia. Vietnam tried to use the preexisting Payments for Forest Environmental Services program for REDD+, incentivizing community-based forest management. Indonesia asked all provinces to clarify emission-reduction plans in green growth strategies, before engaging with international REDD+ finance. Maintaining strong national control over forests was a key motivation for initial REDD+ adoption, but further development of the programs in both countries rebalances efficiency and fairness in instrumental and relational decision-making modes, encompassing various dimensions of morality beyond financial gains.}

At the turn of the 21st century, many spatial planning models, technological trends, environmental challenges, and socio-economic realities are influencing African cities’ dynamics largely causing confusion and a lack of consistent planning policies. To efficiently guide a coherent and coordinated vision, frame an integrated long-term spatial logic, and give a precise direction for sustainable urban development, this paper aims to develop a localized and contextualised analysis of urban planning challenges and development strategies shaping African cities. The study provides a broad perspective looking at the potentiality of spatial planning practices to envision and transform urban life by prospecting integrated urban planning and development strategies to face increasing urban challenges in Africa. Through Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and machine-learning tools, the study brings, for the first time, consolidated and updated knowledge of urban planning practices in Africa. We analysed 243 urban studies, published between 2000 and 2023, in 107 African cities. We identified and scrutinised 17 most pressing urban challenges and 16 most applied urban strategies to address those challenges. Accordingly, the study’s findings suggest shifting the spatial planning paradigm towards urban resilience as an interoperable system of different spatial planning policies and their relevant urban development strategies. Furthermore, the study’s key arguments are to improve urban infrastructure and optimize existing cities to reverse environmental degradation and guide urban fast transformation to adapt and mitigate growing climate change catastrophes.}

In addition, there is no stage framework or a common set of CSFs for blockchain technology in the extant literature. Therefore, this review study aims to develop a stage framework and identify a common set of CSFs for successful blockchain technology implementation by analyzing published articles related to the studied domain. This review study adopted a systematic literature review and a science mapping approach to objectively identify a common set of CSFs, research gaps, and future research directions. Focusing on 78 journal articles retrieved from the Scopus database, influential journals, keywords, countries/regions, and documents in the domain of CSFs for blockchain technology in construction were analyzed. The results revealed that countries like China, USA, UK, and Australia have made the most contributions to this domain. Of the 22 CSFs, five main common sets for blockchain technology were (1) decentralized system (protocol), (2) transparency in data information for construction lifecycle processes, (3) ensuring data immutability, (4) increasing data security and reliability, and (5) providing full traceability of prefabrication. In the stage framework of CSFs for blockchain technology, some CSFs play an essential role throughout the entire construction life cycle processes (e.g., CSF#1 decentralized system and CSF#2 transparency in data information for construction life cycle processes). Four key research gaps and future research directions are proposed. They include (1) digital innovation, (2) smart contracts and information management, (3) intelligent construction, and (4) data analytics methods and techniques. Overall, the findings and checklist of CSFs for blockchain technology would be beneficial for successful exploration and practice in this field.}

Similarly, our findings show that existing research that examines other firm and cross-country drivers of risk, such as national accounting, auditing, economic, governance, language, and legal systems, are not well documented. By contrast, our review illustrates that there is an increase in the number of studies published in recent years with over one-half of those that we review in this research published in the last six years of our sample period. Furthermore, our results suggest that past review studies have also focused excessively on the immediate firm-level characteristics, such as firm size, growth, leverage, value, and cost of capital.

Achieving rapid, sensitive detection of contaminants is extremely important for timely environmental pollution monitoring and treatment. Quantum dot (QD) probes have become a common method for the detection of contaminants. In particular, the development of QDs based on nonmetallic element-doped carbon materials QDs and other nonmetallic doped Si QDs, MoOx QDs, MoS2 QDs, and MXene QDs provides a more convenient and effective means of detecting pollutants. However, a comprehensive summary of the application of nonmetal-doped QD probes for contaminant detection is still lacking. To address this issue, in the present work we mainly categorize different nonmetal-doped QDs into “top-down” and “bottom-up” strategies based on their preparation methods. QD probes based on nonmetal doping have unique optical properties, such as a narrow excitation spectrum, optical tunability, high fluorescence quantum yield (QY), and fluorescence stability. Fluorescence sensing technology can be realized through sensing mechanisms such as fluorescence/dynamic quenching, photoinduced electron transfer (PET), internal filtering effect (IFE), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Considering the ease of implementation, operation, and immediate response of fluorescence sensing technology, it has been widely used in research for the detection of environmental pollutants. We have found that fluorescence sensing technology based on nonmetal-doped QD probes can achieve rapid detection of pollutants (such as heavy metals in water or food, harmful nonmetallic ions, organic pesticides, and antibiotic residues), and its limit of detection (LOD) can reach the picomolar level for trace detection. In addition, the fluorescence sensing technology of nonmetallic QD probes can be combined with smart devices to realize real-time monitoring of pollutants. Our work provides additional strategies for developing nonmetal-doped QD probe-based detection of contaminants and advancing future environmental governance.}

This review paper offers a synthesis of the current philosophy of a FEW nexus in connection with the realm of urban growth models (UGMs) to signify the paradigm collision and shift with interdisciplinary sustainability insights. Findings indicate that urban metabolism and urban ecology in relation to FEW sectors can be incorporated into UGMs with scales via multicriteria decision analysis as FEW technology hub integration can play a critical role in UGMs via a common cellular automata (CA) architecture for both model construction and solution procedure. Synergies between FEW sectors and CA-based UGMs as well as tradeoffs across FEW technology hub integration are highlighted to reflect the cascade effects and higher order impact on urban metabolism and urban ecology. This concept was confirmed with a case study in Miami, Florida, the United States for demonstration. Such synergistic framework is helpful for fostering more sustainable, green, smart, forward-looking, environmentally-sound, socially equitable, risk-informed, resilient, and cost-effective urban growth simulations. It is anticipated that the proposed hybrid FEW-CA-based UGMs can fully account for interactions of context- and culture-driven issues for multi-scale and multiagent urban planning and design in different countries.}

abstract = {The architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is plagued with complex and difficult problems such as late payments, inadequate information sharing and supply chain issues. Thus, advances in blockchain technology are increasingly investigated as a viable digital technology to address such problems. This advantage has led to blockchain gaining significant traction within the AEC industry thus piquing the interests of researchers. Although prior reviews on blockchain have been well appreciated, those studies do not give a complete picture of blockhain in the AEC industry as a whole. For example, whereas some researchers focused their studies on the construction industry, others did so across multiple domains. And researchers who attempted to review blockchain in the AEC industry employed a qualitative methodology which have been criticized for its lack of reproducibility and susceptibility to subjective biases. Moreover, those studies which utilized a quantitative approach employed a single science mapping tool for its analysis, which did not meet the criteria for a robust science mapping research. Therefore, there is the need for further review research efforts to supplement the limitations of the previous works. Thus, this study presents a robust science-mapping based analysis of the state-of-the art research on blockchain technology in the AEC industry, by combining three scientometric tools to analyze quantitatively, 12,549 relevant bibliographic data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The results revealed that blockchain can be used as an optimization technology to optimize processes, systems, activities, and decision-making in the AEC industry. The findings confirmed that blockchain is being utilized to resolve AEC management problems in supply chain, projects, risk, cost, privacy, and security. The study further disclosed Industry 4.0 technologies that have presently been integrated with blockchain to improve its practicability in the AEC industry, as well as the understudied research areas. Within the existing corpus of literature on blockchain, the research findings are informative in identifying and comprehending trends and patterns, including core research topics, countries, and institutions and their interconnection. This study contributes to the global body of knowledge in blockchain by providing a holistic view of the state-of-the-art development of blockchain and proposes the directions of future research efforts, while promoting the consciousness of blockchain in the AEC industry.}

Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), a permissioned blockchain, enhances performance through its modular design and pluggable consensus. However, integrating HLF with enterprise applications introduces latency challenges. Researchers have proposed numerous latency performance modelling techniques to address this issue. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of HLF’s latency by employing various modelling approaches and exploring techniques to improve network latency. However, existing HLF latency modelling studies lack an analysis of how these research efforts apply to specific use cases. This paper examines existing research on latency performance modelling in HLF and the challenges of applying these models to HLF-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. We propose a novel set of criteria for evaluating HLF latency performance modelling and highlight key HLF parameters that influence latency, aligning them with our evaluation criteria. We then classify existing papers based on their focus on latency modelling and the criteria they address. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of latency performance modelling from various researchers, emphasizing the challenges in adapting these models to HLF-enabled IoT blockchain within the framework of our evaluation criteria. Finally, we suggest directions for future research and highlight open research questions for further exploration.}

The uniqueness of study in this field originates from its comprehensive and integrated methodology, which takes into account not only the technical features of energy storage systems but also the economic, social, and regulatory variables that impact their adoption and functioning. A notable feature of research in this field is its focus on actively involving and including the community. Neighborhood and community battery projects aim to empower communities by engaging them in decision-making processes and providing incentives for their participation in energy storage programs, thus enabling them to take charge of their energy future. This approach, which focuses on the community, not only enhances the acceptability and implementation of energy storage devices but also cultivates a feeling of ownership and accountability for the energy system. In summary, the research conducted on neighborhood and community battery projects is characterized by its creative methodology, with the goal of establishing energy systems that are both sustainable and robust, resulting in benefits for both communities and the environment. There is a scarcity of scholarly articles in the existing literature that specifically examine the evaluation of community and neighborhood battery systems.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Current European (EU) policies, such as the Green Deal, envisage safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) practices for the management of chemicals, which cogently entail nanomaterials (NMs) and advanced materials (AdMa). These practices, applied at the earliest stages of innovation and throughout the life-cycle of chemicals, materials and products, could prevent and/or minimise their environmental, health and safety (EHS) and sustainability impacts. This requires a shift from the established risk control paradigms towards prevention-based approaches at the design stage that accelerate the development of safer and more sustainable chemicals, materials, products and processes, while promoting a transition towards a circular economy and a more sustainable future. The EU commission has funded several Horizon 2020 projects applying the concepts of SSbD to nanotechnologies, biotechnologies and advanced materials. This article is inspired from the answers and opinions shared during a stakeholders meeting arranged throughout the workshop entitled ‘Safe and Sustainable by Design Paradigms applied to NMs and AdMa’, held in Venice, Italy, in September 2022. The goal of the workshop was to identify differences and overlaps between the SSbD approaches and to provide common messages on the progress towards the implementation of concrete SSbD concepts, and to reveal challenges faced in their realistic and straightforward execution. In this article, we provide insights into the intersecting industrial domains, the technical and organisational challenges to the practical implementation of the SSbD, and future financial directions in supporting and maintaining the digital products currently under development within the H2020 projects, in order to ultimately enable their uptake by industry and regulators.}

In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have been dedicated to exploring the applications of blockchain and privacy computing technologies in the process of data value release. Scholars have discovered that the combination of the two technologies can alleviate many pain points of each other. Specifically, privacy computing is a computational theory and method for protecting privacy of information throughout its lifecycle. Privacy computing enables the processing, analysis, and computation of data while preserving the confidentiality of the original information. Nevertheless, challenges related to data ownership and benefit distribution impede the establishment of a fair and effective collaborative environment among multiple parties, thereby restricting its further practical development. On the other hand, blockchain is a technology for establishing a trusted platform among mutually untrusted parties, characterized by decentralization, immutability, traceability, and incentive mechanisms. However, blockchain also faces security issues such as transparency of on-chain data and lack of protection in smart contract execution environments. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively analyze and explore the integration of blockchain and privacy computing from both perspectives, focusing on bidirectional utilization. We systematically categorize and summarize relevant literature in this field, employing problem-oriented approaches. Finally, we identify the existing challenges and propose potential improvement methods in this field.}

At the same time, systems thinking as a ‘buzz-word’ has gained relevance for approaching complex problem areas in all kinds of disciplines including those preoccupied with the subsurface. This paper reviews the literature about urban underground planning through a systems-lens. To set this in context, it is outlined how organizational principles for the urban subsurface have evolved, and the main aspects of systems thinking are introduced followed by a discussion of how this thinking could be applied to the urban underground. Strategies and tools presented in the recent literature in the field are then reviewed based on this perspective, asking how systemic the proposed strategies and tools are when the local geology, as well as legal and institutional settings are accepted as a baseline for analysis or intervention. Systemic approaches built on this premise have the potential to capture existing and evolving complexities, foster a better understanding of the value of subsurface space for a city and ultimately enable an efficient and fair allocation of underground space. However, propositions for holistic solutions remain dispersed, interventions often remain based in an engineering mindset, and a shift in mind-set remains a challenge. More research in collaboration with local and regional administrations or authorities based on systems thinking frameworks could help to facilitate this shift.}

abstract = {Background
Innovative models of health care that involve advanced technology in the form of a digital hospital are emerging globally. Models include technology such as machine learning and smart wearables, that can be used to integrate patient data and improve continuity of care. This model may have benefits in situations where patient deterioration must be detected quickly so that a rapid response can occur such as cardiopulmonary settings.
Aim
The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the evidence for a digital hospital model of care, in the context of cardiac and pulmonary settings.
Design
Scoping review.
Data sources
Databases searched were using PsycInfo, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL. Studies written in English and containing key terms related to digital hospital and cardiopulmonary care were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews was used to assess the risk of bias.
Results
Thirteen (13) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For cardiac conditions, a deep-learning-based rapid response system warning system for predicting patient deterioration leading to cardiac arrest had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods. There was also a reduction in the number of patients who needed to be examined by a physician. Using continuous telemonitoring with a wireless real-time electrocardiogram compared with non-monitoring, there was improved initial resuscitation and 24-hour post-event survival for high-risk patients. However, there were no benefits for survival to discharge. For pulmonary conditions, a natural language processing algorithm reduced the time to asthma diagnosis, demonstrating high predictive values. Virtual inhaler education was found to be as effective as in-person education, and prescription error was reduced following the implementation of computer-based physician order entry electronic medical records and a clinical decision support tool.
Conclusions
While we currently have only a brief glimpse at the impact of technology care delivery for cardiac and respiratory conditions, technology presents an opportunity to improve quality and safety in care, but only with the support of adequate infrastructure and processes.

abstract = {As the threat of COVID-19 recedes, wastewater surveillance – unlike other pandemic-era public health surveillance methods – seems here to stay. Concerns have been raised, however, about the potential risks that wastewater surveillance might pose towards group privacy. Existing scholarship has focused upon using ethics- or human rights-based frameworks as a means of balancing the public health objectives of wastewater surveillance and the potential risks it might pose to group privacy. However, such frameworks greatly lack enforceability. In order to further the strong foundation laid by such frameworks – while addressing their lack of enforceability – this paper proposes the idea of the ‘obligation’ as an alternative way to regulate wastewater surveillance systems. The legal codification of said obligations provides a method of ensuring that wastewater surveillance systems can be deployed effectively and equitably. Our paper proposes that legal obligations for wastewater surveillance can be created and enforced through transparent and purposeful legislation (which would include limits on power and grant institutions substantial oversight) as well as paying heed to non-legislative legal means of enforcement, such as through courts or contracts. Introducing legal obligations for wastewater surveillance could therefore be highly useful to researchers, policymakers, corporate technologists, and government agencies working in this field.}

Wetlands provide ∼$47.4 trillion/year worth of ecosystem services globally and support immense biodiversity, yet face widespread drainage and pollution, and large-scale wetlands restoration is urgently needed. Payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes provide a viable avenue for funding large-scale wetland restoration. However, schemes around the globe differ substantially in their goals, structure, challenges, and effectiveness in supporting large-scale wetland restoration. Here, we suggest wetland-based PES schemes use common asset trusts (CATs) to build investment portfolios of wetlands across landscapes that sustain and enhance overall provision of multiple ecosystem services. CATs can meet the needs of multiple investors, permit bundled payments, and provide flexibility to invest in the restoration of numerous services/values, all using a coordinated, highly collaborative, prioritized, and transparent process. CATs would support financial viability, facilitate efficiency to reduce administrative burdens, and enable credibility and social licence building to restore wetland values and services globally.}

Buildings are a major primary energy consumer in the world energy sector, with a value of about 40% of total energy consumption. The absence of traditional sources of energy currently promotes the development of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). The general definition of net zero energy construction is very critical to grasp. The aim of the paper is to overview the literature on the existing NZEB to make them self-sustaining and net zero in order to improve energy efficiency of the buildings. If enough renewable energy could be used, NZEB could potentially be achievable with power production. Furthermore, different building-service systems utilizing renewable energy sources have been extensively investigated for possible uses in NZEB. The paper gives the detail of its climatic condition in various part of the world along with their consequences and its impacts. The NZEB concept will significantly define the demand and supply strategies for renewable energies and conversion accounting to achieve a NZEB target along with its renewable energy evaluation. Buildings account for a large proportion of the world's total energy and carbon emissions, and play an important role in formulating strategies for sustainable growth. To this end, smart systems implement applications with numerous and interdisciplinary features. Here, the paper gives a detailed literature review on NZEB.}

Our findings reveal that data-centered solutions, sensor aided cyber physical systems, green consumption, vendor support, technological roadmap, gain legitimacy on the use of data analytics, and acceleration of digital transformation are the most significant enablers for sustainable business practices in SMEs. In addition, cloud enterprise resource planning is found to be the most significant enabler for developing countries. The barriers are mainly related to the implantation of the enablers. Among those major barriers are security of the data storage, lack of trust, lack of top management support, resistance to change to the new technology, lack of skilled workforce, data breaches, and poor network security. Our findings have key policy implications for practitioners and policy makers.}

While there is consensus that focusing on both adaptation and mitigation is necessary for addressing climate change impacts, better understanding of their interactions is needed to efficiently maximize their potentials. This paper, first, provides a bibliographic analysis to map existing knowledge regarding adaptation-mitigation interactions. This is done using methods such as bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. Then, drawing on the literature, this study explores two types of interactions between adaptation and mitigation measures, namely co-benefits and synergies. These interactions are explored through analyzing evidence reported in the literature on different measures related to sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, water, green infrastructure, urban planning, and governance. Results of the bibliographic analysis show that there is a lack of research in the Global South. Results of the detailed content analysis show that many measures can provide co-benefits and synergies. Measures related to green infrastructure, buildings, energy systems, and, transportation are particularly capable of providing co-benefits. In addition, it was found that appropriate levels of density, promotion of public transportation, and urban greenery are measures that are more likely to provide synergistic benefits if combined with other adaptation and/or mitigation measures. This study highlights the need for more empirical research to better understand the magnitude of synergistic benefits between different measures.}

abstract = {Rice is one of the major staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and is mainly grown in three environments: rainfed upland and rainfed and irrigated lowlands. In all rice-growing environments, the yield gap (the difference between the potential yield in irrigated lowland or water-limited yield in rainfed lowland and upland and the actual yield obtained by farmers) is largely due to a wide range of constraints including water-related issues. This paper aims to review water management research for rice cultivation in SSA. Major water-related constraints to rice production include drought, flooding, iron toxicity, and soil salinity. A wide range of technologies has been tested by Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) and its partners for their potential to address some of the water-related challenges across SSA. In the irrigated lowlands, the system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying significantly reduced water use, while the pre-conditions to maintain grain yield and quality compared to continuous flooding were identified. Salinity problems caused by the standing water layer could be addressed by flushing and leaching. In the rainfed lowlands, water control structures, Sawah rice production system, and the Smart-Valleys approach for land and water development improved water availability and grain yield compared to traditional water management practices. In the rainfed uplands, supplemental irrigation, mulching, and conservation agriculture mitigated the effects of drought on rice yield. The Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) approach was developed to work with and educate communities to help them implement improved water management technologies. Most of the research assessed a few indicators such as rice yield, water use, water productivity at the field level. There has been limited research on the cost-benefit of water management technologies, enabling conditions and business models for their large-scale adoption, as well as their impact on farmers’ livelihoods, particularly on women and youth. Besides, limited research has been conducted on water management design for crop diversification, landscape-level water management, and iron toxicity mitigation, particularly in lowlands. Filling these research gaps could contribute to sustainable water resources management and sustainable intensification of rice-based systems in SSA.}

abstract = {Water scarcity is among key the challenges facing sheep production in the arid and semiarid areas, and is predicted to worsen in future. Despite sheep in dry areas being capable of surviving relatively long periods with little water, deficiency of this essential nutrient produces lightweight carcasses and dark, dry and less tender meat. Responses to impacts of water scarcity have often been reactive rather than proactive, focusing on crisis rather than risk management. To effectively minimise the impact of water scarcity on dryland sheep meat production and quality, water-scarce countries should adopt a new paradigm for water management aimed at risk reduction. This entails identification and adoption of a menu of local recovery and resilience interventions spanning the spectrum from management of water, feed and animals to human resources capacitation. Most of the existing recovery and resilience strategies in water-scarce sheep producing countries have, however, not been widely adopted due to lack of evidence, resources, and adaptive capacity. The current review, therefore, discusses the impacts of water scarcity on sheep meat production and quality, and identifies a portfolio of local recovery and resilience strategies for adoption by dryland countries.}

abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.}

abstract = {Higher education institutions (HEIs) can play a key role in the transition to the circular economy (CE) given their missions, characteristics and role in shaping the coming generations of citizens and leaders. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of HEIs as microcosms for transitioning to circular models. Through a semi-systematic literature review, it focuses on the systemic transformation of HEIs and uses quantitative and qualitative content analysis to map 72 research papers covering the topic. The paper also introduces a methodological approach to address the complex nature of HEIs as intricate systems. The analysis reveals the presence of six main themes relevant to CE implementation in HEIs: education and research; campus physical facilities; tools and activities for greening the campus; material flows and waste management; collaboration, stakeholder engagement and behaviours; and frameworks for CE implementation. The analysis showed a growing interest in CE implementation in HEIs and evidence of the potential of HEIs to foster the transition towards it. However, an organized approach is currently lacking as is an understanding of how to apply CE practices within HEI systems. Recommendations for future research include comparing academic research findings with grey literature from HEI networks and other credible organizations.}

abstract = {Sustainability is a pressing need, as well as an engineering challenge, in the modern world. Developing smart technologies is a critical way to ensure that future manufacturing systems are sustainable. Blockchain is a next-generation development of information technology for realizing sustainability in businesses and industries. Much research on blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 has been conducted from technical, commercial, organizational, and operational perspectives. This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and social barriers that blockchain technology must overcome to demonstrate its sustainability in industrial and business spheres.}
