abstract = {Information technology (IT) is broadly recognized as an important element in organizational innovation, however there has been relatively little integration of Information Systems (IS) research on the role of IT in organizational innovation. Such integration is particularly important in view of recent calls to examine the evolving ontological nature of IT, wherein IT artifacts are now shaping physical reality. We systematically examine innovation-related literature published in the leading IS journals in the period between 2009 and 2020 and we identify and summarize the core theoretical discourses in this domain. We find that extant literature largely examines the role of IT in innovation at a high level of abstraction, focusing on IT investments and IT capabilities, and consequently precluding granular insights on who, what, when, where, how, and why in relation to organizational innovation. To address this limitation and to provide a structuring lens for future research, we develop the organizational innovation system framework which posits that actors, IT artifacts, actions and organizational context are the key elements in organizational innovation systems that require more granular examination to yield deeper insights on how information technology contributes to organizational innovation. We re-examine the literature through the organizational innovation system lens and we identify gaps in extant research. We also outline potential directions for expanding the scope of future research.}

This paper examines how the pandemic caused a water security crisis for many communities, and in so doing, our analysis contributes to current debates on water system resilience and continued challenges of water affordability in the United States. Water utilities faced major shifts in industrial and domestic water demand, financial burdens of increased non-payments, and operational challenges due to a reduced workforce and supply chain bottlenecks. Areas of concern include customer protection, financial security, public communication, new technology adoption, and trust. Evidence indicates that the pandemic water crisis spurred institutional and technological innovation to increase resilience for the next shock while overall financial challenges in the post-pandemic years remain. The pandemic water crisis also revealed a stark tradeoff between household water security and water utility security, indicating that without systemic changes to policy and practice related to water affordability, the most vulnerable in the United States will continue to suffer in future crises.}

It also presents meticulous summaries of water reports released by the government and non-governmental organizations with special emphasis on health–based targets, proposed strategies related to preventive risk management (through water safety planning), environmental impact assessment (EIA), and independent surveillance in Pakistan. This paper reviews various studies published in national and international journals and reports, released by the government and non-governmental organizations, to provide a summary of the current knowledge with regards to the contemporary water quality management system that is still developing in the country. Role of agencies and their policies for water quality management and monitoring is one of the most important impact categories that has been covered in this review. The reviewed publications provide strong support for claims that impacts of unsafe water on health and economy of a country are very dangerous. Improved access to safe drinking water by a development-oriented strategy can have tangible improvements in socioeconomic status of a country.}

abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing rapid economic growth and rising demand for energy, accompanied by significant low energy access and sustainability challenges. Globally, to address similar issues and unlock a region's energy potential, regional integrated energy systems have gained traction, and initiatives such as establishing power pools for regional electricity markets, cross-border power exchanges, and integrating renewable energy resources are being promoted. This paper describes the status of regional integrated energy systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. We analyze the energy growth achieved through effective strategies and policies that support regional integrated energy systems in developed and developing regions (the United Kingdom and China). Our findings show that challenges, including limited access to financing, regulatory barriers, lack of effective energy planning model, inadequate supporting policies, and fragmented institutional frameworks, hinder the region's widespread deployment of regional integrated energy systems. Taking lessons from the case studies, addressing SSA's energy challenges requires concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, and the private sector to create enabling policy environments, mobilize investments, and build technical capacity and supporting infrastructures. Regional integrated energy systems can enhance energy security by diversifying energy sources, fostering economic development, and stimulating cross-border energy trade. In the United Kingdom, the implementation of integrated energy systems has contributed to a 25% reduction in carbon emissions and a 15% increase in energy efficiency over the past decade. Similarly, in China, the integration of renewable energy sources into regional energy systems has led to a 30% increase in renewable energy capacity and a 20% decrease in coal consumption since 2010. China owns 32% of global renewable energy market, alongside an installed capacity of about 1.26 TW in the first quarter of 2023. Our findings from the power pools indicate that three out of the four pools possess significant hydro energy resources. Specifically, within the CAPP region, 7 out of 10 countries heavily rely on hydro energy, while in EAPP, 6 out of 11 countries exhibit a similar dependency. Moreover, within SAPP, 9 out of 12 countries and within WAPP, 5 out of 14 countries rely significantly on hydro energy.}

This is evident from the exponential growth of ESS demand in recent years. The global energy storage capacity is expected to exceed 1000 GW by 2040. In Malaysia, it is predicted that there will be rapid growth of ESSs in line with the goal to achieve the renewable energy penetration target of 31 % by 2025. The growth of renewable energy in Malaysia is mainly driven by solar energy, owing to its strategic location in the tropics. In this regard, ESSs are seen as the key enabler that can promote solar hosting in Malaysia by alleviating the technical issues arising from their integration. In this study, a comprehensive review on the benefits of ESSs in power systems is first presented and the research gap associated with ESS-solar photovoltaic integration is highlighted. Subsequently, the key opportunities and applicability of ESSs in Malaysia's power systems are identified and discussed. Furthermore, the potential development phases of ESSs are classified for the period from 2020 to 2035, considering the renewable energy development scenarios in Malaysia. This research can serve as an information resource for power utility companies as well as researchers on the opportunities of future ESSs development in Malaysia.}

The results indicate that perceived severity (β=0.197), perceived vulnerability (β=0.160), response efficacy (β=0.251) and self-efficacy (β=0.270) are positively associated with COVID-19 disease. In addition, the results show that Response cost (β=−0.074) is a negative and weak predictor of motivation to protect against COVID-19. The results of this study regarding Protection Motivation Theory (PMT)- as a very strong and flexible theory during outbreak of COVID-19- may suggest that despite positive protection, the mean of Effect Size of total PMT elements is less than average size. Meta-analysis of studies shows that coping appraisal variables provide the strongest predictors of behavior and intention. Furthermore, self-efficacy was identified as the most important determinant in protective behaviors against COVID-19.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
CONTEXT
Narratives dominate the agricultural discourse that digitalisation is the ‘silver bullet’ to agricultural, environmental, and global issues, resulting in an external push towards automation and a rapid increase in digital technologies in the sector. Concentrated productivist views and techno-optimist hype and momentum is carrying us briskly towards a digital farming revolution, with little conversation or consideration of the social impacts of digitalisation. The application of social science research to digital agriculture is relatively new and the pace at which it has been developing to keep up with digital advances in the sector has left this body of literature scattered and lacking sufficient overview.
OBJECTIVE
To address this, a scoping study was conducted on social and behavioural science literature related to digital agriculture.
METHODS
This scoping study, which incorporates 200 references, pays particular attention to stakeholder engagement and how agricultural digitalisation has been developing. This methodology enables us to provide an extensive overview of this field of research, presenting key themes pertaining to the literature including barriers and facilitators of, as well as anticipated positive and negative impacts of digital technology adoption.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We find that whilst there has been a general win-win, techno-positive narrative in the agricultural sector, proof of these benefits is limited and some technologies are eliciting negative effects to its users, transforming the landscape of agriculture.
SIGNIFICANCE
In order to be responsive to these negative consequences, it is important that we turn our attention upstream to examine how technologies are designed and developed for use in an agricultural context. This can be achieved by integrating more inclusive approaches to technology design. These approaches will help to mitigate negative effects of technologies, help to create successful and responsible innovations, tackle low adoption issues, and help to create more responsible digital futures.}

Despite such advancement in regenerative engineering, the clinical translation remains a major challenge. In the stance of personalized treatment, the recent progress in bioelectronic medicine likewise evolved as another important research domain of larger significance for human healthcare. Over the last several years, our research group has adopted biomaterials-based regenerative engineering strategies using innovative bioelectronic stimulation protocols based on either electric or magnetic stimuli to direct cellular differentiation on engineered biomaterials with a range of elastic stiffness or functional properties (electroactivity/magnetoactivity). In this article, the role of bioelectronics in stem cell-based regenerative engineering has been critically analyzed to stimulate futuristic research in the treatment of degenerative diseases as well as to address some fundamental questions in stem cell biology. Built on the concepts from two independent biomedical research domains (regenerative engineering and bioelectronic medicine), we propose a converging research theme, ‘Regenerative Bioelectronics’. Further, a series of recommendations have been put forward to address the current challenges in bridging the gap in stem cell therapy and bioelectronic medicine. Enacting the strategic blueprint of bioelectronic-based regenerative engineering can potentially deliver the unmet clinical needs for treating incurable degenerative diseases.}

To evaluate the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on the implementation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) through a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517375).
Participants and Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and grey literature from January 2010 to February 2024, focusing on IMCI/iCCM-related terms and excluding non-ICT interventions. A meta-analysis synthesized the impact of ICT on clinical assessment, disease classification, therapy, and antibiotic prescription through Odds Ratio (OR; 95%CI) employing a random-effects model for significant heterogeneity (I2>50%) and conducting subgroup analyses.
Results
Of 1,005 initial studies, 44 were included, covering eight interventions for IMCI, seven for iCCM, and two for training. All digital interventions except one outperformed traditional paper-based methods. Pooling effect sizes from 16 studies showed 5·7 OR for more complete clinical assessments (95%CI:1·7-19·1, I2 95%); 2·0 for improved disease classification accuracy (95%CI:0·9-4·4, I2 93%); 1·4 for more appropriate therapy (95%CI:0·8-2·2, I2 93%); and 0·2 for reduced antibiotic use (95%CI:0·06-0·55, I2 99%).
Conclusion
This review is the first to comprehensively quantify the impact of ICT on the implementation of IMCI/iCCM programs, confirming both the benefits and limitations of these technologies. The customization of digital tools for IMCI/iCCM can serve as a model for other health programs. As ICT increasingly supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, the effective digital interventions identified in this review can pave the way for future innovations.}

abstract = {Purpose
Maintenance services have evolved hugely from an inevitable part of production as a failure fixing activity to an essential strategic element to accomplish several business objectives including profit making. With the growing maintenance service industries, sustainability has remained a challenge and have garnered a great deal of attention over the last two decades. Maintenance services' impact on sustainability is a known concern and almost all sustainability dimensions are affected either positively or negatively. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss the related literature on different maintenance services and their impact on sustainability.
Design/methodology/approach
This research aims to study these concepts (maintenance services, sustainability impact and digitalization) independently and in relation to each other through systematic literature review of high-quality articles, with a focus to understand the relation between maintenance and sustainability and depict the role of digitalization in achieving those sustainability goals.
Findings
This study presented the trend and publications related to maintenance services and its sustainability impact throughout 2009 to 2020. Publications related to maintenance services and corresponding sustainability impact were analyzed as a problem space and publications related to digitalization were analyzed as a solution space. Based on the analysis, a discussion on digitalization of maintenance service was conducted to highlight possible benefits and improvements towards various sustainability impacts.
Originality/value
Digitalization and digital technologies are evolving and advancing every day. It is still yet to be known, what role could digitalization play in the maintenance services' impact on sustainability. This paper contains a state of the art on publications and discussion related to the digitalization for sustainable maintenance services. It offers insights and information on the current body of knowledge to academics, researchers, practitioners, maintenance personnel, digital managers, development teams and stakeholders concerned with maintenance services.}

Rare diseases affect over 300 million people worldwide and are gaining recognition as a global health priority. Their inclusion in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Resolution on Addressing the Challenges of Persons Living with a Rare Disease, and the anticipated WHO Global Network for Rare Diseases and WHO Resolution on Rare Diseases, which is yet to be announced, emphasise their significance. People with rare diseases often face unmet health needs, including access to screening, diagnosis, therapy, and comprehensive health care. These challenges highlight the need for awareness and targeted interventions, including comprehensive education, especially in primary care. The majority of rare disease research, clinical services, and health systems are addressed with specialist care. WHO Member States have committed to focusing on primary health care in both universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Recognising this opportunity, the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) assembled a global, multistakeholder task force to identify key barriers and opportunities for empowering primary health-care providers in addressing rare disease challenges.}

abstract = {Despite the 2009 World Health Organization recommendation that all countries introduce rotavirus vaccines (RVV) into their national immunization programs, just 81 countries had introduced RVV by the end of 2015, leaving millions of children at risk for rotavirus morbidity and mortality. In response, the Rotavirus Accelerated Vaccine Introduction Network (RAVIN) was established in 2016 to provide support to eight Gavi-eligible countries that had yet to make an RVV introduction decision and/or had requested technical assistance with RVV preparations: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Benin, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Nepal. During 2016–2020, RAVIN worked with country governments and partners to support evidence-based immunization decision-making, RVV introduction preparation and implementation, and multilateral coordination. By the September 2020 program close-out, five of the eight RAVIN focus countries successfully introduced RVV into their routine childhood immunization programs. We report on the RAVIN approach, describe how the project responded collectively to an evolving RVV product landscape, synthesize common characteristics of the RAVIN country experiences, highlight key lessons learned, and outline the unfinished agenda to inform future new vaccine introduction efforts by countries and global partners.}

This research explores the current trends in CE-research in construction and identifies gaps for future directions in connecting stakeholders for CE. Hence, a systematic literature review (quantitative and qualitative) was undertaken. The quantitative analysis identified a gradual increase of CE research in construction. The qualitative content analysis revealed that there is a tendency to adapt various models/frameworks, actions for CE adaption, strategies for stakeholder collaboration, and, digital technologies to connect stakeholders for CE. Lack of promoting CE is a key challenge that needs to be addressed for efficient stakeholder collaboration.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in health care are on the agenda of policymakers around the world, but a major challenge remains, namely, to set policies that will ensure wide acceptance and capture the value of AI while mitigating associated risks.
Objective
This study aims to provide an overview of how OECD countries strategize about how to integrate AI into health care and to determine their actual level of AI maturity.
Methods
A scan of government-based AI strategies and initiatives adopted in 10 proactive OECD countries was conducted. Available documentation was analyzed, using the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development's roadmap to AI maturity as a conceptual framework.
Results
The findings reveal that most selected OECD countries are at the Emerging stage (Level 2) of AI in health maturity. Despite considerable funding and a variety of approaches to the development of an AI in health supporting ecosystem, only the United Kingdom and United States have reached the highest level of maturity, an integrated and collaborative AI in health ecosystem (Level 3).
Conclusion
Despite policymakers looking for opportunities to expedite efforts related to AI, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensure the sustainable development and safe use of AI in health. The principles of equifinality and mindfulness must thus guide policymaking in the development of AI in health care.}

Collective targets set by private, government, and non-government organizations to achieve global “zero net deforestation” by 2020 have been missed. Here, we explore the limitations of zero deforestation (ZD) targets and commitments. We review the origins of the ZD concept and explore conceptual and practical challenges with attaining ZD. Conceptual challenges include problems with defining “forest,” social equity, and agricultural expansion leaking to non-forest ecosystems. Practical challenges include implementing ZD in highly complex supply chains. We reflect on the framing of ZD and discuss principles to support post-2020 conservation targets and commitments. We emphasize the importance of defining relationships between global goals and targets, national targets, and commitments. We call for research to understand the impacts of ZD commitments on local stakeholders in diverse contexts, including highly forested landscapes. Reframing ZD will not solve deforestation, but reflecting on its limitations could support more effective and equitable tropical forest conservation beyond 2020.}

The current parochialistic approach adopted by majority of the MENA countries continues to foster competition, despite the complementary relationships that can potentially arise between their resource systems. Consequently, food security is one area which is vastly suffering at unprecedented scales threatening the prosperity in the MENA region. On the other hand, the MENA countries share similar socio-economic and geo-political characteristics, and therein lies an opportunity to create a novel strategic ecosystem for enhancing cooperation between them to achieve greater resilience in regional food security. In this paper, the tools used to model competition and the enabling mechanisms for cooperative approaches were reviewed, including applications of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory in EWF nexus systems. A real-life example of the usefulness of game theoretic models is illustrated through a transboundary EWF nexus-based cooperative framework which links the available resources and assets in the MENA region and offers a fertile field to enhance food security and greater socio-economic and environmental resilience in the region.}

On the basis of ensuring the safety and stability of the power system, it distributed energy provides effective energy utilization and intelligent control to promote low-carbon, ecological, and intelligent development. This eased the difficulty of implementing the concept of sustainable development in national ecological renewal design, economic development, and energy conservation and environmental protection. Under the traditional urban planning system, there is no comprehensive energy plan except for special plans such as electricity, gas, and thermal engineering, which shows that in the traditional urban planning system, the understanding of energy development and utilization is still very weak. Air pollution caused by energy consumption is becoming more and more serious, energy demand is increasing rapidly, and more and more attention is paid to urban energy. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the emphasis on energy development and comprehensive utilization in the design of eco-city, and make it suitable for urban renewal design. At the same time, this paper also conducts a more in-depth discussion on the types of energy planning and the characteristics of eco-city. The results have shown that the resource allocation rate has been increased to about 98% after energy planning, which is a qualitative leap. At the same time, the environmental quality of the eco-city has been improved by more than 40%, the quality of life of the residents has been improved, the awareness of environmental protection has been enhanced, and the economic benefits will inevitably increase.}

Researchers and sector stakeholders increasingly realize that this container market segment has its distinct dynamics and demands. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the reefer container sector, its most important characteristics and trends, and a systematic review of the academic literature on reefer containers and logistics. First the authors outline the characteristics, composition, and development of the reefer container market, showing its growth through modal shift (from conventional reefer ships and airfreight) and differentiation into new cargo markets and niche services. Secondly the authors outline reefer chains in terms of their relevant stages, stakeholders, and processes. Data on insurance claims shows that cold chain failure and cargo loss not only occur due to technical failures, but just as often due to organizational errors – especially due to hold-up risk at container transfer points. Thirdly the authors map the present knowledge on reefer containers and reefer transportation through a systematic literature review. The current body of research on reefer containers consists mostly of highly specialized, technical studies on product characteristics and quality preservation, monitoring and control, refrigeration technology, and temperature management. While technological advances in these fields have largely enabled the containerization of cold logistics chains, the first sections of this paper also highlight that many current pressing issues in reefer transportation are logistical and organizational in nature. Therefore, the authors propose a research agenda addressing these overlooked aspects, including supply chain coordination issues and implications of reefer market developments for port policy.}

The descriptive analysis was carried out through Bibliometrix tool, while content analysis was performed using Nvivo. The descriptive analysis shows that from 2016 to 2021 the scientific production addressing multi-criteria methods to assess agricultural sustainability started to grow markedly in a very rapid matter, reaching an average of 6 papers per year. France and China are the most scientifically productive countries. The content analysis points out that the most used multi-criteria method is the AHP that was used 11 times. The outranking methods, instead, were used only 3 times. In 68% of the papers the Triple Bottom Line was used as dimensions, and in 41% of the papers the spatial applicability was the farming system. The results highlight that doesn’t exist many MCDM/A methods for assessing agricultural sustainability, and most of them are compensatory. These results point out that the use of multi-criteria methods in assessing agricultural sustainability is still underexplored and can be improved.}

Model aggregation, also known as model fusion, plays a vital role in FL. It involves combining locally generated models from client devices into a single global model while maintaining user data privacy. However, the accuracy and reliability of the resulting global model depend on the aggregation method chosen, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial. Initially, the simple averaging of model weights was the most commonly used method. However, due to its limitations in handling low-quality or malicious models, alternative techniques have been explored. As FL gains popularity in various domains, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the available model aggregation techniques and their respective strengths and limitations. However, there is currently a significant gap in the literature when it comes to systematic and comprehensive reviews of these techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review encompassing 201 studies on model aggregation in FL. The focus is on summarizing the proposed techniques and the ones currently applied for model fusion. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to enhance and develop new aggregation techniques, as well as for practitioners to select the most appropriate method for their FL applications.}

The conceptual framework identifies fifteen themes for consideration by policymakers when designing digital services in tax administrations clustered around four categories – Context, Stakeholders, Technology and Demonstrated Results. The framework should also serve as a reference point in successfully developing strategies and measures to embed digital services in tax administrations.

On the basis of expounding the objectives and specific connotation of China’s carbon peak and carbon neutralization, this paper systematically discusses the main implementation path and the prospect of China’s carbon peak and carbon neutralization. China’s path to realizing carbon neutralization includes four directions: (1) in terms of carbon dioxide emission control: energy transformation path, energy conservation, and emission reduction path; (2) for increasing carbon sink: carbon capture, utilization, and storage path, ecological governance, and land greening path; (3) in key technology development: zero-carbon utilization, coal new energy coupling, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), energy storage technology and other key technology paths required to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutralization; (4) from the angle of policy development: Formulate legal guarantees for the government to promote the carbon trading market; Formulate carbon emission standards for enterprises and increase publicity and education for individuals and society. Based on practicing the goal and path of carbon peak and carbon neutralization, China will vigorously develop low carbon and circular economy and promote green and high-quality economic development; speed up to enter the era of fossil resources and promoting energy transformation; accelerate the integrated innovation of green and low-carbon technologies and promote carbon neutrality. ©2021 China Geology Editorial Office.}

Monitoring and evaluation of MSP is key to inform best practices, adaptive management and plan iteration. While standardised evaluation frameworks cannot be readily applied, accounting for evaluation essentials such as the definition of evaluation objectives, indicators and stakeholder engagement of stakeholders is a prerequisite for meaningful evaluation outcomes. By way of a literature review and eleven practical MSP case studies, we analysed present day trends in evaluation approaches and unravelled the adoption of evaluation essentials for three categories for monitoring and evaluation for plan making, plan outcomes, and policy implementation. We found that at a global scale the focus of MSP evaluation has shifted over the past decade from evaluating predominantly plan outcomes towards the evaluation of plan making. Independent of the scope of the evaluation, evaluation approaches varied greatly from formal and structured processes, building for instance on MSP goals and objectives, to informal processes based on stakeholder interviews. We noted a trend in the adoption of formalised approaches where MSP evaluations have increasingly become linked to MSP policy goals and objectives. However, the enhanced use of MSP objectives and indicators did not result in a more straightforward reporting of outcomes, e.g. such as the achievement of specific MSP objectives. Overall, we found weak linkages between defined MSP objectives, indicators and available monitoring data. While the apparent shift towards a focus on objectives is promising, we highlight the need of fit-for-purpose monitoring data to enable effective evaluation of those objectives. Hence, effective MSP and adaptive management processes require customised and concurrent monitoring and evaluation strategies and procedures. We argue that evaluation processes would also benefit from a better understanding of the general environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural effects of MSP. Therefore, to understand better environmental effects of MSP, we praise that forthcoming MSP processes need to deepen the understanding and considerations of cause-effect pathways between human activities and changes of ecosystem state through the adoption of targeted cumulative effects assessments.}

As a result, there is increasing interest in supporting reef resilience through restoration and adaptation interventions. Different options have been developed, each with differing impacts on the social-ecological system. Choosing which, if any, option to implement requires assessment of their expected performance against a potentially wide range of objectives. We propose an objectives framework that can help decision analysts and decision makers map intervention options and their consequences to what matters for reefs and people. We present an example hierarchy of strategic and tactical fundamental and means objectives for reef restoration. We show that such an objectives hierarchy in conjunction with the modelling of option performance allows restoration choices to be identified that can meet reef management objectives and produce desired outcomes for reef-dependent communities, other stakeholders, and members of society more broadly. Example objectives are derived from government and marine park policy documents as well as a broader set of related academic literature. We show that a hierarchy of clear and well-defined objectives linked to ecological, economic and social values is central to informing multi-objective decision making.}

abstract = {Summary
Clinicians have worked feverishly to treat patients with COVID-19 while also carrying out clinical research studies. We discuss how the clinical research community responded to the pandemic in Europe, what lessons were learned, and provide recommendations for future clinical research response during pandemics. We focused on two platform trials: RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP. Both trials were able to enrol patients very rapidly during the beginning of the pandemic because of pre-established structures and procedures, and because they share simple execution and flexibility to adjust when evidence emergences. However, contracting, regulatory hurdles, and competition with (often inadequately designed or underpowered) national trials was a major challenge in several EU countries. We recommend the creation of structures and partnerships that facilitate prioritisation of clinical research, simplification of clinical trial delivery, development of digital models and procedures for data collection and sharing, development of a mechanism to rapidly leverage pandemic funding and to connect EU funding with national funding, and investment in clinical trial networks, platform trials, and master protocols. Finally, the future pandemic clinical research response of the EU should be embedded in the global response. We believe that globally connected clinical trial networks will be essential to respond more effectively to future infectious diseases outbreaks.}

This review provides a brief history of relevant STS concepts and frameworks and a structured analysis of how STS perspectives are appearing in energy social science research and how energy-related research is appearing in social science STS. Drawing from an initial body of 262 journal articles and books with a stratified sample of 68 published from 2009 to mid-2019, the review identifies four major groups of perspectives: (1) STS-related cultural analysis, especially the study of sociotechnical imaginaries; (2) STS-related policy analysis, such as research on the social construction of risks and standards and on the performativity of economic models; (3) STS perspectives on public participation processes, expert-public relations, and mobilized publics; and (4) the study of sociotechnical systems, including large technological systems, the politics of design, and users and actor-networks. Connections among the perspectives and the value for energy social science research are also critically discussed.}

abstract = {Public concerns surrounding landscape conservation, noise pollution and impacts on bird populations are commonly incorporated into the planning phase of wind energy projects. However, public involvement tends to be highly localized and procedural, aimed at informing local stakeholders and gaining their acceptance for implementation. At the same time, other ways of engaging the public have emerged that move beyond invited stakeholder participation to facilitate the co-production of wind energy technologies and the landscapes in which they are placed. This paper systematically reviews the academic literature with the aim of identifying and characterizing these modes of co-production. A total of 230 papers published between 2009 and 2019 that report on public engagement with wind energy were included in our review. From this sample, we characterise public engagement into three modes of co-production: (1) local co-production, in spatially proximate wind energy projects; (2) collective co-production, performed through collaboration among different actors in the wind energy sector, joined ownership or consumption of wind energy; and (3) virtual co-production, mediated through information technology. These different modes of co-production cover a broad spectrum of ways in which local and non-local publics engage in decisions about where, when, how and by whom wind energy projects are designed, developed and managed over time. Combined, they can offer guidance for future research on how the wind energy sector can further support a transition to sustainable and inclusive energy systems.}

In a Circular Economy (CE), starting from the design stage, resources and products are divided, leased, re-used, repaired, refurbished and recycled as long as necessary, which this extends the product’s life cycle, minimizing waste; when a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept over and over generating additional value. In Korea, due to the past urgent environmental issues, numerous policies related to CE (often referred to as “resources circulation”) were implemented, although there is room for enhancements on circularity here depicted. The expected contribution of this work is to identify the main environmental issues in order to remark the most up-to-date notable Korean policies on CE, and to discuss about possible enhancements that can be effectively addressed through circularity. This manuscript is divided into 5 sections; (1) Introduction, (2) Introduction to CE, (3) Evolution towards a CE in Korea, (4) Discussion, and (5) Conclusion.}

abstract = {Medical data processing has grown into a prominent topic in the latest decades with the primary goal of maintaining patient data via new information technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies, which generate patient indexes in hospital data networks. Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in distributed computing platform applications based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%. Hence, despite how technology changes, delivering appropriate therapy for patients is the primary aim of healthcare-associated departments. Therefore, further studies are recommended to develop more functional architectures based on DL and distributed environments and better evaluate the present healthcare data analysis models.}

Current practices in a linear economy—produce, consume, discard—will not be sufficient to sustain humanity over the long term. At the same time manufacturing is necessary to support the world's ever-growing population. The efficiencies of scale that manufacturing brings to bear on the global economy allow greater sharing of services and resources. Research and practices supporting sustainable manufacturing are necessary to control impacts on the environment. From an engineering perspective, however, those practices are in their infancy.Small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMM) make up the majority of manufacturing firms globally, but many are still unsure of whether and how to embrace sustainability as a driving business imperative. In this study, we explore two interconnected approaches to address sustainability: the benefits of investing in sustainability initiatives for SMM and the use of standards to support such initiatives. In so doing, we analyze reported barriers to SMM pursuing sustainability, the value gained from sustainability-focused operational improvements within SMM, and the benefits of grounding those improvements in standards. The results indicate that 1) reported beliefs surrounding the benefits of pursuing sustainability goals should be refocused in light of the data on business performance and 2) standards developments is foundational to pursuing such objectives. This study examines multiple data sources to reach these conclusions, including open literature, expert interviews, corporate sustainability reports, and performance data across multiple years from programs supporting SMM in improving sustainability performance. The study reviews the role that different standards fill and highlights those that are instrumental in pursuing manufacturing sustainability objectives. While several standards from the business world have emerged to establish industry-specific sustainability disclosures, little guidance is available to manufacturers on how to implement and show improvements to their practices. Recently, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) produced standards to target sustainability goals in specific industrial sectors. Other standards bodies, including ASTM International's E60 Committee on Sustainability and Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing (E60.13), specifically address practical guidance for manufacturing operations in the form of standards. The intent of such standards setting bodies is to make manufacturing more sustainable, yet the organizations have evolved independently. Consequently, their respective standards reflect different types of measures based on the distinct users' perspectives. These and other standards efforts are highlighted as supporting the integration of sustainability goals into manufacturing organizations. These findings demonstrate that (1) integrating sustainability as a business imperative, particularly by SMM, can result in business opportunities and (2) leveraging standards reduces the risk of introducing changes. Future efforts towards more sustainable development can be furthered through the development of voluntary standards for implementing new operational approaches. Such standards can help to engage more SMM in sustainable development by reducing the risk of introducing changes into their existing practices.}

Record climate extremes are reducing urban liveability, compounding inequality, and threatening infrastructure. Adaptation measures that integrate technological, nature-based, and social solutions can provide multiple co-benefits to address complex socioecological issues in cities while increasing resilience to potential impacts. However, there remain many challenges to developing and implementing integrated solutions. In this Viewpoint, we consider the value of integrating across the three solution sets, the challenges and potential enablers for integrating solution sets, and present examples of challenges and adopted solutions in three cities with different urban contexts and climates (Freiburg, Germany; Durban, South Africa; and Singapore). We conclude with a discussion of research directions and provide a road map to identify the actions that enable successful implementation of integrated climate solutions. We highlight the need for more systematic research that targets enabling environments for integration; achieving integrated solutions in different contexts to avoid maladaptation; simultaneously improving liveability, sustainability, and equality; and replicating via transfer and scale-up of local solutions. Cities in systematically disadvantaged countries (sometimes referred to as the Global South) are central to future urban development and must be prioritised. Helping decision makers and communities understand the potential opportunities associated with integrated solutions for climate change will encourage urgent and deliberate strides towards adapting cities to the dynamic climate reality.}

This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government (15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural (30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low-income communities (31%), women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target migrants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa.}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) inflicts significant mortality, morbidity and economic loss in the 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR). With technical assistance and advocacy from WHO, all countries have developed their respective National Action Plans on AMR that are aligned with the Global Action Plan. Historically, the WHO Regional Office has been proactive in advocacy at the highest political level. The past decade has seen an enhancement of the country’s capacity to combat AMR through national efforts catalyzed and supported through several WHO initiatives at all levels—global, regional and country levels. Several countries including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have observed a worrying trend of increasing drug resistance, despite heightened awareness and actions. Recent AMR data generated by the countries are indicative of fragmented progress. Lack of technical capacity, financial resources, weak regulatory apparatus, slow behavioural changes at all levels of the antimicrobial stewardship landscape and the COVID-19 pandemic have prevented the effective application of several interventions to minimize the impact of AMR.}

Although extant research acknowledges this topic to some extent, it offers limited understandings of the causal processes underpinning multi-system interaction. Building on multi-system research in the sustainability transitions literature, the paper therefore aims to develop a first inventory of causal processes of multi-system interactions in net-zero transitions, focused on technological, actor, and institutional dimensions. To elaborate and substantiate this contribution, the paper applies a narrative review methodology to identify six causal processes based on integration of insights from relevant social science theories with a multi-system dynamics approach based on the Multi-level Perspective. We illustrate causal processes with examples from the net-zero transition and articulate their implications for the speed of change.}

New tools, metrics, and methods in agriculture, food systems, and nutrition (A&N) research proliferated in the decade following the 2007–2008 food price crisis. We map these developments across themes derived from conceptual A&N pathways and expert consultations. We created an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) from a systematic search of published and gray literature since 2008, following Campbell Collaboration guidelines. We retrieved over 30,000 reports from published literature databases, and individually searched 20 online repositories. We systematically screened 24,359 reports by title and/or abstract, 1577 by full report, and included 904 eligible reports. The EGM consists of rows of thematic domains and columns of types of tools, metrics, and methods, as well as extensive coding applied as filters. Each cell of the map represents research surrounding a type of tool, metric, or method within a given theme. Reports in each cell are grouped by stage of development, which expand to a corresponding bibliography. Users can filter EGM reports by various characteristics. The 4 most populated domains were: diets, nutrition, and health; primary food production; water, sanitation, and hygiene; and environment and sustainability. The 4 most common types of metrics, methods, and tools were: diet metrics; footprint analysis (especially water); technology applications; and network or Bayesian analysis. Gaps represent areas of few or no reports of innovation between 2008 and 2018. There were gaps in reports and innovations related to: power or conflicts of interest; food environments; markets; private sector engagement; food loss and waste; conflict; study design and system-level tools, metrics, and methods. The EGM is a comprehensive tool to navigate advances in measurement in A&N research: to highlight trends and gaps, conduct further synthesis and development, and prioritize the agenda for future work. This narrative synthesis accompanies the EGM, which can be found at https://www.anh-academy.org/evidence-and-gap-map.}

There have been many calls for cruise tourism to become more sustainable for destinations but little consensus about what this means, or how it could be achieved. The aim of this article is to review the literature on cruise tourism destinations and to unpack the ways in which sustainability issues are framed at destination level. We have reviewed 98 peer-reviewed empirical journal articles (2015–2022). The article shows how the research literature on cruise tourism and sustainability issues has evolved over 7 years, which aspects of sustainability are considered to be most important and/or problematic and what solutions are suggested to improve the sustainability of cruise tourism. We develop three critical avenues towards sustainable cruise destinations: 1) from specific outcomes to the interconnectedness of desired practices, 2) alternatives to the growth paradigm, and 3) governing for coexistence and the commons. These critical avenues are based on the discussion of what sustainability means for cruise destinations, and translates these into pathways of future research.}

We use stylized vignettes of potential NbS to examine how the dimensions of climate justice reveal the potential of NbS to contribute to CRDP. We consider tensions in NbS projects between local and global climate objectives, and the potential for NbS framing to reinforce inequalities or unsustainable practices. Ultimately, we present a framework that combines climate justice and CRDP in an analytical tool for understanding the potential for a NbS to support CRD in specific places.}

The unscrupulous usage of water and higher consumption of energy resulted in an uncontrolled generation of wastewater and enormous usage of fossil fuels. In the seafood industry, energy is primarily used for machinery and equipment handling processes such as freezing, refrigeration, heating, cooling, and drying. Similarly, a huge amount of clean water is used for cleaning machinery and plant, and for operations like washing of raw material, de-icing, defrosting, and salt splashing. As a consequence, in the energy-water nexus, additional energy is required for drawing fresh water and further processing of wastewater demands energy that results in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and incurring additional costs to the plant.

Under this notion, this study explores the integration of sustainability indicators into project management practices of construction projects. Current literature discloses many indicators/key factors as contributing towards the sustainability success of construction projects. However, the lack of an all-encompassing categorization creates difficulties in directing project managers towards their proper utilization. This paper aims to contribute towards the holistic view of sustainability in project management, especially for construction projects. A systematic literature review was conducted towards the understanding of the key topics and the findings were validated through semi-structured interviews. Eighty-two (82) sustainability indicators related to project management practices in construction projects were finally identified. Their categorization into economic, environmental and social/management sustainability indicators was completed through semi-structured interviews with construction experts and via previous literature analysis. The economic related indicators finalized in 27; 18 for the environmental dimension and 37 indicators were included in the social/management dimension. This study contributes to research on sustainable project management for construction projects in two main ways: (1) it provides a holistic view of sustainable project management indicators, covering the full spectrum of the triple constraint (TBL); (2) it offers the possibility for practitioners to choose the right mix of indicators, depending on the sustainability focus they want to provide in their projects.}

First, we capture the modi operandi of different forms of recycling value chains into a typology. We do so based on distinct foci and policy approaches towards the IRS which have been adopted across different countries. Second, we synthesize various threads of information on reported forms of collaboration, tensions, and challenges in the context of urban waste management, into a conceptual framework to facilitate transitions towards circular and inclusive wise-waste systems. Finally, we discuss important aspects related to circular business models and integration approaches towards the IRS, and we propose avenues for further research.}

The Digital Object Architecture (DOA) is a comprehensive architecture for managing digital objects with a persistent identifier assigned by the Handle System. They are applied in several sectors to manage data. However, their utilization faces some limitations. This paper provides a brief overview and explores their real-world application. It also analyzes those architectures’ challenges and suggest ideas for future research to overcome those challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first review that elucidates the DOA and the Handle System. The analysis reveals that most of the research focused on three areas: the IoT (Internet of Things) and IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), educational domain and research, and multimedia content. There are also a few papers on the application in other sectors like logistics and supply chain, authorization, and authentication systems.

abstract = {Protecting the ocean has become a major goal of international policy as human activities increasingly endanger the integrity of the ocean ecosystem, often summarized as “ocean health.” By and large, efforts to protect the ocean have failed because, among other things, (1) the underlying socio-ecological pathways have not been properly considered, and (2) the concept of ocean health has been ill defined. Collectively, this prevents an adequate societal response as to how ocean ecosystems and their vital functions for human societies can be protected and restored. We review the confusion surrounding the term “ocean health” and suggest an operational ocean-health framework in line with the concept of strong sustainability. Given the accelerating degeneration of marine ecosystems, the restoration of regional ocean health will be of increasing importance. Our advocated transdisciplinary and multi-actor framework can help to advance the implementation of more active measures to restore ocean health and safeguard human health and well-being.}

Many services cancelled all routine appointments and surgery, which allowed them to redirect care towards large numbers of infected patients requiring respiratory and other support. Maternity services are relatively unique in that most of the care is time sensitive and cannot be rescheduled. Assessment such as routine bloods need to be taken in early pregnancy, anatomic surveys are best conducted at 20–22 weeks' gestation, and births continue regardless of a pandemic. In this paper we describe how National Maternity Hospital Dublin, with an annual delivery rate of 8000 births, reorganised services to continue to care for our mothers and babies. This included the development of a ‘hospital within a hospital’ approach, and separate physical and care pathways for positive cases. The delivery of virtual outpatient appointments and a comprehensive online patient education portal have proved successful.}

With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated ‘upstream’ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed.}

In this regard, assessment frameworks can play an essential role and guide resilience-building efforts. However, the lack of a comprehensive assessment framework has led to a focus on sectoral evaluation. This study aims to propose an integrated framework for assessing the pandemic resilience of communities. For this purpose, we rely on a systematic review of literature indexed in major academic databases. We have thoroughly analyzed a total number of 115 related documents to extract relevant criteria. Findings show that many criteria and factors affect community resilience to pandemics. By inductive content coding in MAXQDA software, we have categorized these criteria into five dimensions of Institutional, Social, Economic, Infrastructural, and Demographic. Good leadership and management, insurance and governmental support, planning and preparation, expertise and labor, and available equipment and technologies are the most important institutional criteria. Communication and collective identity, mutual support, public safety and protection, public awareness, and social justice are the influential social criteria. Economic sustainability and resource availability are criteria of economic resilience. Sufficiency of services, public spaces, housing tenure, and transportation system are the main criteria related to the built environment and infrastructural dimension. Finally, demographic resilience includes physical health, psychological well-being, life quality, and hygiene. Based on these criteria, this study develops an integrated evaluation framework that researchers can implement along with conventional assessment and ranking methods to determine the level of community resilience to pandemics.}

Findings reveal AI's significant impact on healthcare delivery, including its role in enhancing diagnostic precision, enabling treatment personalisation, facilitating predictive analytics, automating tasks, and driving robotics. AI algorithms demonstrate high accuracy in analysing medical images for disease diagnosis and enable the creation of tailored treatment plans based on patient data analysis. Predictive analytics identify high-risk patients for proactive interventions, while AI-powered tools streamline workflows, improving efficiency and patient experience. Additionally, AI-driven robotics automate tasks and enhance care delivery, particularly in rehabilitation and surgery. However, challenges such as data quality, interpretability, bias, and regulatory frameworks must be addressed for responsible AI implementation. Recommendations emphasise the need for robust ethical and legal frameworks, human-AI collaboration, safety validation, education, and comprehensive regulation to ensure the ethical and effective integration of AI in healthcare. This review provides valuable insights into AI's transformative potential in healthcare while advocating for responsible implementation to ensure patient safety and efficacy.}

Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare.

At the same time, initiatives of city regeneration envision alternative forms of the urban environment, where derelict spaces have the potential to be brought back to life in ways that would not compromise urban health. Regeneration processes should utilise mitigation and adaptation strategies that consider the future needs and anticipated role of cities within the context of the discourse about climate change, accounting for expected and unforeseen impacts and regarding the city as an agent of action rather than a static territory, too complex to change. Nevertheless, literature implicating these three parameters synchronously, namely, climate change, cities, and health, has been scarce. This study aims to fill this gap through a systematic literature review, exploring climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies that can be employed in urban regeneration efforts seeking to mitigate climate-exacerbated phenomena and their impacts on urban health as well as identifying the main trends and opportunities overlooked. Findings show that even though the emphasis is given to the physical actions and impacts of climate change and urban health, an emerging theme is a need to engage civic society in co-designing urban spaces. Synergistic relationships, collaborations and avoidance of lock-in situations appear to be the most significant subtopics emerging from this literature review. One main recommendation is the promotion of a community-driven, inclusive, participatory approach in regeneration projects. That will ensure that different vulnerabilities can be adequately addressed and that diverse population groups will have equitable health benefits.}

Climate emergencies caused by natural or anthropogenic activities have tragically consequential repercussions on agricultural output worldwide. Modern cropping systems profoundly rely on synthetic fertilizers to deliver necessary nutrients, yet their prolonged and persistent administration is hazardous to the environment, soil fertility, and nutritional dynamics of the rhizospheric microbiome. By addressing the drawback of physico-chemically synthesized nano-dimensioned fertilizer, this review emphasizes on integrating nanoparticles and biofertilizers conjointly as nano-biofertilizers (NBF) which can safeguard global food security, in light of the population surge. Inoculation with nanoparticles and biofertilizers strengthens plant growth and stress tolerance. However, combined together (NBF), they have emerged as a more economically and environmentally sustainable, highly versatile, and long-lasting agriculture tool. Microbe-based green synthesis using the encapsulation of inorganic nanoparticles of Si, Zn, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ti, and Ag as well as organic materials, including chitosan, cellulose, and starch, to formulate NBFs can eliminate the constraints of conventional fertilizer contamination. The application of NBFs is in its infancy in agriculture, yet it has promising potential for transforming traditional farming techniques into smart agriculture, compared to any of the existing strategies. From this perspective, this review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formulations, fabrication, and characterization of NBFs while unraveling the underlying mechanisms of plant-NBF interactions along with their contribution to climate change-induced biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. We substantially summarize the latest advancements of field applications of NBFs for precision farming. Moreover, we critically revised their applications in agro-ecosystems according to the current literature, while also discussing the bottlenecks and future trends for developing potent NBFs.}

With the objectives of technological innovation and equipment upgrading, we have conducted an in-depth study of the key aspects of coal mine methane emission reduction that should be developed in a coordinated manner during the carbon peak and carbon neutrality stages, and the development pathway of AGE under the dual-carbon background was constructed. The sustainable development characteristics of “low-carbonization of the extraction system(L)-accurate drilling construction(A)-intellectualization of equipment development(I)-dynamic regulation of whole process(D)” was proposed at the carbon peak stage, ultimately achieving zero emission from CH4 extraction-low emissions of CO2. At the carbon neutrality stage, the overall planning of the whole industry chain of methane emission reduction should be emphasized, and the means of source management should be continuously implemented. In order to construct a technically reliable-low cost-long term safe carbon emission reduction technology system and ultimately hasten the accomplishment of China's “dual-carbon” strategic goal, full-concentration gas gradient utilization, “CCUS + ecological carbon sink” and other carbon negative technologies will be further strengthened. A literature review was further used to summarize the key technical model and equipment system for AGE, and to describe the limitation, implications and future direction of this research.}

The aim of this article is to review, analyse and discuss in detail the problems faced by urban ecosystems due to water surplus and scarcity, as well as the need of adaptation to climate change taking into account the legislation, current challenges and knowledge gaps. The literature review indicated that urban floods are much more recognised than urban droughts. Amongst floods, flash floods are currently the most challenging, which by their nature are difficult to monitor. Research and adaptation measures related to water-released hazards use cutting-edge technologies for risk assessment, decision support systems, or early warning systems, among others, but in all areas knowledge gaps for urban droughts are evident. Increasing urban retention and introducing Low Impact Development and Nature-based Solutions is a remedy for both droughts and floods in cities. There is the need to integrate flood and drought disaster risk reduction strategies and creating a holistic approach.}

The current trend is therefore to re-establish wetlands, often with an aim to achieve the simultaneous delivery of multiple ecosystem services, i.e., multifunctionality. Here we review the literature on key objectives used to motivate wetland re-establishment in temperate agricultural landscapes (provision of flow regulation, nutrient retention, climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation and cultural ecosystem services), and their relationships to environmental properties, in order to identify potential for tradeoffs and synergies concerning the development of multifunctional wetlands. Through this process, we find that there is a need for a change in scale from a focus on single wetlands to wetlandscapes (multiple neighboring wetlands including their catchments and surrounding landscape features) if multiple societal and environmental goals are to be achieved. Finally, we discuss the key factors to be considered when planning for re-establishment of wetlands that can support achievement of a wide range of objectives at the landscape scale.}

One of the most significant shifts that defines Industry 5.0 is the change in focus from technology-driven progress to a genuinely human-centric approach. This means that the industrial sector should prioritize human needs and interests at the core of the production process. Instead of replacing workers on the shop floor, technologies should enhance their capabilities, leading to a safer and more fulfilling work environment. Consequently, the role of industrial operators is undergoing a substantial transformation. This subject has garnered increasing interest from both researchers and industries. However, there is a lack of comprehensive literature covering the concept of Operator 4.0. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the role of Operator 4.0 within the manufacturing context. Out of the 1333 papers retrieved from scientific literature databases, 130 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and underwent detailed analysis. The study aims to provide an extensive overview of Operator 4.0, analyzing the occupational risks faced by workers and the proposed solutions to support them by leveraging the key enabling technologies of Industry 4.0. The paper places particular emphasis on human aspects, which are often overlooked although the successful implementation of technologies heavily relies on who uses them and how they are utilized. Finally, the paper discusses open issues and challenges and puts forth suggestions for future research directions.}

abstract = {Recently, the academic and scientific debate has been strongly focused on the use of digital technologies to address sustainability issues. In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link “digital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs” in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs.}

To address, this study conducts an integrated critical review to identify the application of CDVT and assess their contribution to the prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of flood risk management. The results show that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twin technologies are the primary CDVT used in urban flood visualisation, with virtual reality being the most frequently used. The focus of urban flood visualisation studies has been primarily on preparation and mitigation stages. However, there is a need to investigate the application of these technologies in the entire urban water cycle. Furthermore, there is potential for greater adoption of digital twin, especially in simulating urban flood inundation and flood evacuation routes. Integrating real-time data, data-driven modeling, and CDVT can significantly improve real-time flood forecasting. This benefits stakeholders and the public by enhancing early warning systems, preparedness, and flood resilience, leading to more effective flood risk management and reduced impacts on communities.}

Meanwhile, adopting modern means of production using digital innovations can boost farmers' efficiency. Given the relevance of digital innovations within the agribusiness industry, the current paper gives an overview of digital innovations in the agribusiness industry, particularly in Africa, by synthesising existing literature on digital innovations to consolidate scattered ideas and give recommendations for practice and future studies. The PRISMA technique was adopted to synthesise 47 existing relevant articles from the Scopus database. Bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer and R-Package-Bibliometrix were used to analyse the data. From the results, most papers on African digital innovations emanated from a journal with a broader scope—Sustainability Journal (Switzerland). Most of the funding for digital innovation studies in agribusiness was sponsored by foreign donors outside the African Continent, with the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers in France sponsoring the most research. Based on the publication synthesis and the trend of publications, five themes, namely, digital innovations in the agricultural value chain, training and skills development through digital innovations, digital finance innovations in agribusiness, precision digital innovations: agribusiness survival, and drivers of digital innovation adoption in agribusiness were identified. From the results, digital agribusiness innovations in marketing, production, and finance have been profound in Africa, though they are skewed towards a few South, West, and North African countries. Meanwhile, the drivers and challenges of digital innovations in Africa have been mainly social, economic, political, and institutional factors. Given the results, it is recommended that, since most of the studies were primarily sponsored by foreign governments, thus betraying the commitment of the African continent's readiness to transform the agribusiness sector via innovation and technology, African Governments, first, and second, non-governmental organisations and other agricultural donors should prioritise the digitalisation of the agriculture sector by integrating them into economic development plans and making relevant resources available to all actors from upstream to downstream.}

abstract = {Background
Cardiac telerehabilitation has demonstrated effectiveness for patient health outcomes, but uptake and implementation into practice have been limited and variable. While patient-level influences on uptake have been identified, little is known about provider- and system-level factors.
Aims
To identify provider and system barriers and enablers to uptake and implementation of cardiac telerehabilitation.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted, including a search of six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) from 2000 to March 2023. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles. Study quality was evaluated according to study design by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative data, the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies (AXIS), and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for mixed methods. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis.
Results
Twenty eligible studies (total 1674 participants) were included. Perceived provider-level barriers included that cardiac telerehabilitation is resource intensive, inferior to centre-based delivery, and lack of staff preparation. Whereas provider-level enablers were having access to resources, adequate staff preparation, positive staff beliefs regarding cardiac telerehabilitation and positive team dynamics. System-level barriers related to unaligned policy, healthcare system and insurance structures, technology issues, lack of plans for implementation, and inadequate resources. System-level enablers included cost-effectiveness, technology availability, reliability, and adaptability, and adequate program development, implementation planning and leadership support.
Conclusions
Barriers and enablers at both provider and system levels must be recognised and addressed at the local context to ensure better uptake of cardiac telerehabilitation programs.}

In this review, we attempt to bridge the corresponding literature gap regarding modern cybersecurity technologies that deploy AI techniques to improve their performance and compensate for security and privacy vulnerabilities. In this direction, we have systematically gathered and classified the extensive research on this topic. Our findings highlight the fact that the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques improves both the performance of cybersecurity measures and their speed, reliability, and effectiveness. This may be proven to be useful for improving the security and privacy of IoMT devices. Furthermore, by considering the numerous advantages of AI technologies as opposed to their core cybersecurity counterparts, including blockchain, anomaly detection, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, federated learning, and so on, we provide a structured overview of the current scientific trends. We conclude with considerations for future research, emphasizing the promising potential of AI-driven cybersecurity in the IoMT landscape, especially in patient data protection and in data-driven healthcare.}

abstract = {Inland Waterway Transport (IWT) is recognized as energy efficient, with lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions and large freight capacity when compared to other modes. Therefore, IWT helps to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030 Agenda (SDGs) that relate to sustainable transport. Still, transport sustainability assessments must include environmental, social and economic issues. This paper reviews recent research aiming to provide a conceptual definition of sustainable inland waterway transport that relates to the SDGs, and to identify gaps in literature for future research. To accomplish this task, a cluster analysis-based taxonomy was built through the intuitive approach, with peer-reviewed papers published between 2015 and 2020. The sample was classified into twelve clusters of IWT sustainability issues, which were related to SDGs and their targets. Results show increased scientific interest in eco-friendly practices. However, social issues remain underappreciated. We present a definition for sustainable IWT and the pathways for future research to achieve higher sustainability levels, as prescribed by the 2030 Agenda.}

Different sustainability strategies are applied to achieve these three goals. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the status and implementation of various sustainable fishery management strategies in the Philippines over the past 20 years. We identified various management themes and the extent these themes are related to economic, social and environmental sustainability goals using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and text mining. Six sustainability management themes were identified. The analysis shows that overall, the sustainability management themes appear to be socio-economic in nature based on the relative occurrences of indicators belonging to the three sustainability goals. When comparing the strength of the three sustainability goals in each management theme, the social goal appears to be most prominent in four management themes, the economic goal in one theme, and a balance of the three sustainability goals in another theme. Furthermore, this study shows which fishery management themes are most (dis-)similar based on clustering. Policy makers and other fishery management bodies can use these insights to optimize the sustainability goals in fisheries by not only relying on a single management theme in each fishery, by improving focus on large scale fishers, by incorporating underexplored sustainability indicators, and by adapting current trends and proven-to-be effective management themes.}

There is an ongoing digital revolution in the field of Parkinson's disease (PD) for the objective measurement of motor aspects, to be used in clinical trials and possibly support therapeutic choices. The focus of remote technologies is now also slowly shifting towards the broad but more “hidden” spectrum of non-motor symptoms (NMS).
Methods
A narrative review of digital health technologies for measuring NMS in people with PD was conducted. These digital technologies were defined as assessment tools for NMS offered remotely in the form of a wearable, downloadable as a mobile app, or any other objective measurement of NMS in PD that did not require a hospital visit and could be performed remotely. Searches were performed using peer-reviewed literature indexed databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials), as well as Google and Google Scholar.
Results
Eighteen studies deploying digital health technology in PD were identified, for example for the measurement of sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension. In addition, we describe promising developments in other conditions that could be translated for use in PD.
Conclusion
Unlike motor symptoms, non-motor features of PD are difficult to measure directly using remote digital technologies. Nonetheless, it is currently possible to reliably measure several NMS and further digital technology developments are underway to offer further capture of often under-reported and under-recognised NMS.}

abstract = {Objective
Effective use of telehealth offers substantial benefits to older persons and aged care providers. However, data privacy concerns challenge the effective use of telehealth and subsequent business value. Through developing a theoretical model, we explain how privacy concerns can influence the adoption ad use of telehealth in this complex context.
Method
An integrative review of empirical investigations was conducted by linking privacy concerns, telehealth use, and aged care. We searched three major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) for articles published until December 2020. Articles were analyzed and presented using an integrative theoretical model that we labeled CPCPO (Context-Privacy Concerns-Practice-Outcomes).
Results
Our review revealed that privacy concerns are a contextual concept, i.e., different contexts (users, telehealth systems, aged care services, data) produce different privacy concerns. We found that privacy concerns were more voiced in home telecare and were associated with the degree of telemonitoring and surveillance. Contextual privacy concerns were related to video recording, behavioral data (e.g., sleep patterns and eating behavior), location data, and future use of data. These concerns can influence the adoption and use of telehealth. However, privacy protection practices (e.g., informed consent) can help in reducing the concerns and improving the acceptance of telehealth for older persons.
Conclusion
CPCPO offers contextual explanations of telehealth privacy concerns and systems use. For improving telehealth acceptance, privacy concerns of data processing (e.g., recording, collection, storage, and secondary use) must be addressed by performing data protection practices. Based on the review results, we suggest avenues for future research.}

To this end, a systematic literature review was carried out, consisting of three main phases: planning, conducting, and reporting. The study adhered to the PICOC guidelines (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context) to structure the review. A literature search across six databases led to the analysis of thirty-one primary studies. These studies were selected using the StArt tool, based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among these criteria, a quality assessment was highlighted, evaluating four aspects: the alignment of the primary studies with the review and three aspects related to bibliometric data, including the publication venue and the number of citations. The results reveal that the concept of sustainable energy differs from renewable energy and is divided into two categories: renewable sources and functionalities. This study proposes five dimensions to categorize the constructs: environmental, technical, economic, social, and institutional. The theories that most influenced behavior in favor of sustainable energy include socio-psychological, cognitive, and normative beliefs. Future research should focus on the integration of technology and renewable energy sources to promote sustainable energy, ensuring its effective and economically viable operation, regardless of external factors. Understanding approaches, theories, and modalities related to sustainable energy consumption can contribute to the establishment of new strategies to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.}

To understand these gaps, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review through a socio-technical lens of more than 2.8 million references and 380 selected studies on industrial decarbonization. This research uses a socio-technical lens across the industrial supply chain and delves into the classes of raw materials and feedstocks, pre-processing, manufacturing, and waste and recycling.

Yet, technoscience is offering new tools that have the potential to reimagine how inland fisheries are assessed and managed. So-called “technoscience” refers to instances in which science and technology unfurl together, offering novel ways of spurring and achieving meaningful change. This paper considers the role of technoscience and its potential for modernizing the assessment and management of inland fisheries. It first explores technoscience and its potential benefits, followed by presentation of a series of synopses that explore the application (both successes and challenges) of new technologies such as environmental DNA (eDNA), genomics, electronic tags, drones, phone apps, iEcology, and artificial intelligence to assessment and management. The paper also considers the challenges and barriers that exist in adopting new technologies. The paper concludes with a provocative assessment of the potential of technoscience to reform and modernize inland fisheries assessment and management. Although these tools are increasingly being embraced, there is a lack of platforms for aggregating these data streams and providing managers with actionable information in a timely manner. The ideas presented here should serve as a catalyst for beginning to work collectively and collaboratively towards fisheries assessment and management systems that harness the power of technology and serve to modernize inland fisheries management. Such transformation is urgently needed given the dynamic nature of environmental change, the evolving threat matrix facing inland waters, and the complex behavior of fishers. Quite simply, a dynamic world demands dynamic fisheries management; technoscience has made that within reach.}

In this review article, we investigate if and how the SDG agenda is included in the application of participatory approaches and co-production of knowledge for climate change adaptation. We review findings from such processes in projects whose objective is to foster adaptation in the context of SDGs and to categorize the methods employed to forward co-production. We investigate 1) whether and how co-production approaches localize SDG targets and address tradeoffs and synergies, 2) whether they focus on power asymmetries and political dimensions in such participatory processes, and 3) whether and how the literature show that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift in the role of researchers towards a more interventionist approach to co-production. Our results show that there is little evidence that the SDG agenda contributes to a shift towards more interventionist or transformative approaches within climate change adaptation. Further, we have a identified a missed opportunity in the exclusion of “social” SDGs (SDG 5 and 10) in the discussions of adaptation and co-production and SGDs. Most importantly, we find that participatory efforts, including the co-production of knowledge, for localizing SDG goals and resolving tradeoffs and benefits, are the most salient aspects that tie the three co-production - adaptation - the SDG agenda together. Such participatory localizing processes have a great potential in facilitating long-enduring empowerment and legitimacy in adaptation efforts.}

Bioenzymes have been widely used for propulsion and functionalization of micro/nanomotor because of their advantages of high efficiency of catalytic reaction and mild reaction conditions (suitable pH and temperature). With the optimization of the performance of micro/nanomotor after linking bioenzymes, diverse preparation strategies and a wide range of application scenarios have emerged. Therefore, the design methods in multiple applications of bioenzyme linked micro/nanomotor must be compared, and key points in the preparation strategies must be summarized to synthesize bioenzyme linked micro/nanomotor with robust performance and a wide range of applications.

Finally, we discuss the key points of the preparation of bioenzyme linked micro/nanomotor from the perspective of the preparation materials, preparation methods, propulsion control, and tracking and localization. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and construction of smart catalytic microplatforms with precise motion, excellent catalytic performance, and biocompatibility without contamination, so that bioenzyme linked micro/nanomotor can be applied to address the corresponding needs in areas such as environmental remediation, industrial manufacturing, and biomedicine.}

abstract = {The Named Data Networking is a popular future internet architecture designed around the content name. This data-centric network architecture sought to improve routing techniques, traffic management, network performance, and more. It also adopted a data-centric security paradigm to ensure content authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. Several challenges need to be addressed to achieve such a comprehensive security goal. Innovative blockchain-based security solutions were widely used to address such challenges. Blockchain could offer a secure platform for advanced security features like decentralized identity, distributed trust management, and many more. The current trend is to use blockchain to secure key management operations in Named Data Networking. This survey aimed to identify key management challenges in Named Data Networking and how they were mitigated using blockchain. For this purpose, the survey comprehensively reviewed the existing blockchain-based key management systems for Named Data Networking. It summarized how these systems solve different key management problems using blockchain. It also performed a comparative analysis of these systems based on three references. Firstly, the systems were analyzed to investigate their conformance to the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommendations for secure key management. Secondly, the systems were examined concerning the Named Data Networking platform to reveal information about their key namespace and key object structure. Thirdly, the systems were analyzed based on the blockchain platform and compared regarding their functionality, performance, and security. The content stored in the blockchain was also examined to uncover the relationship between the key, key name, and blockchain. The survey concluded by identifying research gaps and opportunities for further research. This paper contributed to gaining knowledge about key management security challenges faced by Named Data Networking. It revealed how blockchain technology addressed these key management security challenges. It also identified blockchain features that can be adopted to secure key management operations further. The survey results provided a template to guide future research to secure key management in NDN with blockchain.}

abstract = {Loss and Damage studies have tended to focus on rapid-onset events with lesser attention to slow-onset events such as drought. Even when discussed, narratives around droughts emphasize implications on rural populations and there remain empirical and conceptual gaps on drought impacts in urban areas. We focus on losses and damages associated with urban drought and water insecurity through a review of interventions and policies in seven Asian countries. We find evidence of urban droughts leading to tangible losses (e.g. groundwater over-extraction, economic impacts) and intangible losses (e.g. conflict, increased drudgery). We highlight examples of Asian cities minimizing urban drought-related losses and damages through nature-based, institutional, technological, and behavioral adaptation interventions. We argue that water management policies that take into account current and projected L&D of urban droughts as well as beyond-urban dynamics of water availability and sharing are essential for effective climate adaptation.}
