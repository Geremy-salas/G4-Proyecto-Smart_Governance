The Farm to Fork Strategy asserts that research and innovation are key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems, from primary production to consumption. Therefore, in this paper, the most promising fields of innovation towards this transition in the agrifood sector have been reviewed with reference to the value chain actors engaged in their implementation. Although not exhaustive, this short survey presents a selection of solutions that have in recent years been viewed as ‘first mover’ opportunities for innovation in the agrifood sector where changes have been initiated but need to be further implemented. The paper first discusses options that allow agrifood businesses to operate directly as innovation providers, and then expands on the role of public stakeholders, namely consumers, policy makers and researchers, to act as agents of change and contribute to pave the way to a ‘green deal’ in Europe. The survey concludes by highlighting the possibility of developing integrated approaches to research and innovation to ensure the sustainability of the food system through cooperative actions engaging both private and public actors in the value chain.}

While there has been an increasing research interest in the development of such passports, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no well-formed, common definition and explanation of the concept itself. This also reflects in the various alternative terminology used to indicate this phenomenon (product passport, material passport, resource passport, recycling passport, cradle-to-cradle passport, etc.). A unified understanding of a concept, its components, variables and relationships would however contribute toward more precise communication of research ideas, findings and discussions about such passport development. Using a descriptive research approach, we aim to study this field in order to formalize the concept. This work points out, that many of the passport variants, pursue a similar goal and have similar characteristics and contextual challenges. Based on the similarities and conceptual boundaries identified, we suggest that these passports can best be defined as a digital interface composing a certified identity of a single identifiable product by accessing the set of life cycle registrations linked to this object in order to yield insight into the sustainability and circularity characteristics, the circular value estimation, and the circular opportunities for both that product and its underlying components and materials. This work serves as a basis to better specify the general holistic requirements and architectures for these passports that may be developed collaboratively by multiple supply chain stakeholders.}

abstract = {The Central Asian area is confronted with a number of acute obstacles as it attempts to transition to a long-term electrical power supply. Small-scale hydropower systems may be a viable answer to these problems. Central Asian nations' hydropower resources are allocated unevenly. Regardless, it remains the most exploitable renewable energy source in the area, with both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan possessing some of the world's highest hydropower potential. Nonetheless, for fossil-fuel-rich nations like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, hydropower will play a significant role in the future energy balance. Furthermore, because rivers often run across many boundaries, water security plays an important role in cross-border relations between Central Asian countries. To achieve effective exploitation of small hydropower potential, technological and financial expenditures are needed to improve the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of diverse hydroelectric equipment by increasing lifetime, improving efficiency, and increasing yearly power output. Several of these issues can be resolved by installing small and micro hydropower plants in the many minor rivers and irrigation canals. A pumped hydro energy storage system should also be tested and certified for better usability. A hydrological digital twin of relevant river system and irrigation network should be constructed to increase the understanding for performance and enable system-level improvement. Furthermore, optimal performance necessitates constant monitoring of the network, necessitating the development of intelligent monitoring employing sensors in conjunction with control systems and smart grid interactions. This review focuses on the broad and efficient use of these existing resources, which are still underutilized.}

Therefore, analysis of the level of scientific research in SMSC is necessary. A scoping review was conducted in this work utilizing three search engines (Web of Science, Academic Premier Search, and Google Scholar) to discover SMSC research on three primary topics: sustainability, climate-induced migration, and climate resiliency. Since 1901, 6493 SMSC papers were published. Of these, 25 sustainability, 61 migration, and 57 climate resiliency papers on SMSC were identified and reviewed. Sustainability literature is lacking globally, mainly being conducted in European countries. Climate migration literature shows a clear underrepresentation of the role of SMSC in the global migration system. The resilience literature review demonstrated locational gaps by research theme and a need for more specific climate related hazard research globally. A lack of research means a lack of understanding of what consequences SMSC may face under a changing climate. This paper provides suggestions on focus areas for future SMSC research.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Critical minerals are those minerals containing elements, typically metals, and element allotropes which play an irreplaceable role in the ongoing revolution in technology and manufacturing needed to progress society to a high-tech, clean-energy future. The global market for critical minerals is highly vulnerable due to supply chain monopoly risks. Moreover, the mining, processing and refining of these elements involves substantial environmental and health risks, including, but not limited to, ecosystem degradation, chemical pollution, and hazards related to chemical and particulate exposure. Countries such as Australia, therefore, have developed national critical minerals strategies, which include investment in research to develop improved recovery methods and processing technologies. Australia has escalated continuous flow chemistry and critical minerals as critical priorities of national interest. In lieu of this, this review paper assesses the role of solvent extraction and other processing innovations using microchannel systems for the recovery of critical minerals. Microfluidic devices have captured worldwide attention for miniaturising reactor dimensions and, hence, provide huge potential for advancing the application of chemical processes that require precise control, enhanced mixing and rapid reactions. For mineral processing, continuous-flow operation can lead to advantages for extraction efficiency, processing time (productivity), and selectivity. Thus, this review summarises the up-to-date extraction performance of microfluidic devices along classes of critical minerals, as defined by their grouping in the periodic table. Attention is given to the fluidic concept used, e.g. the flow patterns, and how the microfluidic system is configured. From there, the achieved performance is reviewed, both for model and real world extractant solutions, the latter includes multiple minerals and issues of selectivity. Finally, a proposed recommendation is that microfluidics used should aim to impact the whole processing and supply chain, and to support and contribute to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) profiling, a crucial demand faced by the mining industry. The enabling technologies not only have the potential to change the environmental profile, but will also require a highly skilled and trained workforce, and hence can create new employment opportunities.}

abstract = {As a fundamental transportation mode, maritime logistics has become an indispensable component on a global scale. However, there are multiple drawbacks associated with ports operating in traditional ways, such as higher cost, lower efficiency and generating more environmental pollution. Digital technologies have been researched and implemented gradually in green ports, especially in data collection and real-time monitoring, and these advances help to promote higher work efficiency and reduce detrimental environmental impacts. It was found that green ports (e.g. ports of Raffina, Los Angeles, and Long Beach) generally perform better in energy conservation and pollutant emission reduction. However, considering the variability in the level of digitalization, there are challenges in achieving effective communications between individual ports. Therefore, to optimize and update green port practices, a systematic review is necessary to comprehensively analyze the beneficial contributions of green ports. This review adopted bibliometric analysis to examine the shipping framework focusing on green ports digitalization and innovation. After that, with regards to the bibliometric results, five aspects were analyzed, including environment, performance, policy, technology, and management. Besides, intelligent life-cycle management was systematically discussed to improve green ports and maritime logistics performance and sustainability in three aspects, namely waste discharge, shipping management system and green ports management. The findings revealed that green ports and maritime logistics require digital cooperation, transformation, and management to achieve sustainable development goals, including route selection and control of ships' numbers, weather prediction, and navigational effluent monitoring, albeit with some obstacles.}

The main goal of this paper is to carry out a multi-voiced multicriteria analysis that integrates the preferences of local researchers and decision makers in a process aimed at prioritizing watersheds that require the implementation of groundwater management instruments. Using the Criterium Decision Plus system, criteria and subcriteria were integrated into a spatial multi-voiced decision model for the prioritization of watersheds for groundwater resources management. The criteria chosen were Groundwater quality, Groundwater quantity, Land use with potential pollutant load, Equity and Intrinsic aquifer vulnerability. Criteria and subcriteria preferences analysis were derived from workshops with local researchers and decision makers. The spatial multi-voiced decision model identified five of the fourteen watersheds as high to very high priority and requiring groundwater resources management. Based on the local researchers' and decision makers' preferences and hierarchy scheme of the multi-voiced decision model the main criteria and subcriteria that contributed to the final model results were identified. Regarding the criteria, Groundwater quality, Equity and Groundwater quantity contributed extensively to the model. The subcriteria contributions to the groundwater resources management came mainly from High intrinsic aquifer vulnerability, Agrochemicals, Groundwater Storage and Groundwater for domestic supply. This proposed procedure showed that time and effort can be directed to using data and preferences to assist in planning and decision making for groundwater resources management.}

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently arisen as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. According to this novel framework, multiple participants train a global model collaboratively, coordinating with a central aggregator without sharing their local data. As FL gains popularity in diverse domains, security, and privacy concerns arise due to the distributed nature of this solution. Therefore, integrating this strategy with Blockchain technology has been consolidated as a preferred choice to ensure the privacy and security of participants. This paper explores the research efforts carried out by the scientific community to define privacy solutions in scenarios adopting Blockchain-Enabled FL. It comprehensively summarizes the background related to FL and Blockchain, evaluates existing architectures for their integration, and the primary attacks and possible countermeasures to guarantee privacy in this setting. Finally, it reviews the main application scenarios where Blockchain-Enabled FL approaches have been proficiently applied. This survey can help academia and industry practitioners understand which theories and techniques exist to improve the performance of FL through Blockchain to preserve privacy and which are the main challenges and future directions in this novel and still under-explored context. We believe this work provides a novel contribution concerning the previous surveys and is a valuable tool to explore the current landscape, understand perspectives, and pave the way for advancements or improvements in this amalgamation of Blockchain and Federated Learning.}

Despite the advanced technologies used in UASs, the integration of UASs into the air traffic management regulatory framework is lacking, which affects air transport. International and regional air transport regulators, having identified the major technological challenges, are gradually developing fundamental principles for the consolidation of manned and unmanned air traffic. In this review, the development of a common framework and fundamental principles set by major international regulatory authorities (International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems) were examined. The related initiatives of major Eastern countries (Russia, China, and Japan) in comparison with Western states (European Union (EU), United States, and United Kingdom) were comprehensively reviewed, focusing on EU activities and projects related to the concepts of operations. Indicative research activities on technology challenges (detect and avoid; command, control, and communication; and artificial intelligence-based unmanned aerial vehicle navigation), jointly identified by all international and national regulatory authorities, were also examined and presented. A comparative analysis of the fundamental principles of the frameworks revealed the similarities and differences between the approaches to the concept and its implementation. In terms of differences, the novel findings and contributions of this review are the different approaches regarding the roles and responsibilities of state authorities in unmanned aircraft traffic management (UTM) as well as approaches for UTM integration into the existing air traffic management systems. Based on this research, scientific groups of regulatory authorities could consider comparing the concepts and frameworks detailed in this review to address the differences and develop a harmonized global UTM framework.}

The safeguarding of consumers from hazardous products, the preservation of supply chain integrity, and the assurance of fair competition all rely on effective anti-fraud strategies. Intelligent packaging technologies are pivotal in reducing food fraud through anti-tampering measures and traceability. However, standalone intelligent packaging technologies cannot alone establish comprehensive traceability within the food chain. This review asserts that integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can bolster traceability and combat food fraud. Blockchain enhances transparency, while AI enables precise analysis of extensive datasets. This comprehensive review critically examines the potential of combining blockchain and AI technologies with intelligent packaging to address food fraud. It thoroughly delineates the strengths and limitations of these technologies in detecting and mitigating fraud across the supply chain. The amalgamation of diverse technologies within intelligent packaging presents a holistic approach to mitigating significant fraud, contingent upon the effective resolution of technical, cost, and safety challenges. In conclusion, integrating sophisticated technologies into intelligent packaging offers a promising avenue to effectively combat food fraud, instill consumer trust, and maintain the integrity of the food supply chain.}

Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions.

A framework to guide organizational telehealth integration is needed that can support safe, accessible, and high-quality telehealth to patients regardless of social and/or economic status. The purpose of this article is to propose an innovative telehealth model, supported by systems theory, to address the complexity of telehealth implementation in health care organizations. A Donabedian approach is used to address quality. The telehealth model is an organizational infrastructure that outlines how policy and authority requirements, organization factors, provider competencies, and patient determinants of health influence safer, more equitable, higher-quality telehealth. The framework can guide leaders in building, redesigning, and measuring the impact of telehealth programs as health care shifts into a revolutionary technology era to meet the needs of diverse organizations and populations.}

abstract = {The global discourse on climate change, emphasises the need for a rapid clean energy transition. National net-zero commitments are highly contingent on fossil fuel phaseout. India showed active leadership in the Glasgow Summit, 2021 by setting its Renewable Energy targets to 500 GW by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070. However, these entail major energy justice concerns as 80 % of India's electricity consumption is driven through fossil fuel sources. The phase-out of thermal power would hence pose risks to revenues, infrastructure, and employment. With costs and benefits of transition being unequally distributed, the social and economic burden is most likely to be shifted to rural populations, women, children, elderly, and vulnerable communities with weak agency to negotiate transition patterns. Thus, the question of ‘who benefits and how’ is central to India's energy transition story. Majority of the literature on energy justice emerges from the West and addresses questions of opportunities, challenges, economic implications, and policy, at the cost of exploring how justice concerns are embedded in transition dynamics. This study adopts a systematic approach to analyse energy transitions literature in the Indian context to identify how justice discourse interjects within this scholarship in terms of problematization and conceptualisation. In addition to exploring focus areas, methodological, geographical, and temporal trends, the study synthesises the literature to draw out major themes of enquiry. These themes are then analysed using the triumvirate lens of energy justice (distributive, recognition and procedural).}

Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.}

Nature-based Solutions (NBS) have emerged as a systemic approach and an important component of the response to these challenges. In marine and coastal spaces, NBS can contribute to improved environmental health, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and a more sustainable blue economy, if implemented to a high standard. However, NBS have been largely studied for terrestrial – particularly urban – systems, with limited uptake thus far in marine and coastal areas, despite an abundance of opportunities. Here, we provide explanations for this lag and propose the following three research priorities to advance marine and coastal NBS: (1) Improve understanding of marine and coastal biodiversity-ecosystem services relationships to support NBS better designed for rebuilding system resilience and achieving desired ecological outcomes under climate change; (2) Provide scientific guidance on how and where to implement marine and coastal NBS and better coordinate strategies and projects to facilitate their design, effectiveness, and value through innovative synergistic actions; (3) Develop ways to enhance marine and coastal NBS communication, collaboration, ocean literacy and stewardship to raise awareness, co-create solutions with stakeholders, boost public and policy buy-in, and potentially drive a more sustained investment. Research effort in these three areas will help practitioners, policy-makers and society embrace NBS for managing marine and coastal ecosystems for tangible benefits to people and marine life.}

The main objectives can be summarized in presenting sufficient contributions to the new body of knowledge and gathering the recent greenhouse progress in order to support greenhouse engineers, researchers and industrials to achieve higher yields at minimum possible cost. The results reveal that the work carried out over the last 5 years has shown that research and development projects have lent a lot of interest in favor of the greenhouse crops sector. From structural hardware point of view, the choice of an agricultural greenhouse design to meet the economic conditions of greenhouse growers always remains a challenge for the designer. The results report that research concentration has moved from classical controllers to modern ones based on the environment explicit perception.

abstract = {Digital biosensors facilitate real-time, remote, precise disease detection and biochemical analysis. Recent trends in biosensing methods have focused on miniaturization, automation, and multiplexing. The miniaturization of biosensors has led to the development of portable, flexible, and wearable devices that can be used for point-of-care diagnostics and continuous health monitoring. Furthermore, digital automation has enabled the high-throughput screening of samples, reducing the time and cost of analysis, while integrated multiplexing allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of analysis. This article examines recent scientific advances in developing miniaturized biosensing procedures for digital healthcare. Advancements in digital devices have also contributed to the development of integrated biosensing. The use of smartphones, smartwatches, and other digital devices as readout platforms for biosensors has made biosensing more accessible and user-friendly. The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has allowed for the interpretation and analysis of complex biosensor data. This review compares biosensing with current state-of-the-art diagnostic technology. After incorporating biosensors with artificial intelligence in an internet of things platform, they will have enormous potential and market value in the future for personalized healthcare. Based on various device performances and impacts, sensing methods, designs, compatibilities, functionalities, technology integrations, and developments are systematically discussed in this article. The primary objective of this review was to present a comprehensive discussion from the point of view of both technological advancements and translational wisdom. It is essential to have intelligent point-of-care devices with digital technologies for real-time healthcare management.

Based on a qualitative desk review and analyses of secondary data, resilience is framed as a function of the adaptive, absorptive and transformative capacity of socio-political systems to withstand and cope with the adverse effects of disaster. In addition, this study emphasizes the major principles and components of effective big data use; e.g., open source tools, strong infrastructure, local skill development, context-specific data sources, ethical data sharing and experiential learning. This study reveals some important big data technologies that can be easily used in the different phases of disaster management and enhancing resilience such as remote sensing imagery, social media data, crowdsourced data, geographic information system (GIS), and mobile metadata. The findings hold major relevancy for policymakers, administrators, and related stakeholders responsible for taking action before, during and after disasters through training, early warning systems, emergency evacuation, relief distribution and other key infrastructural components.}

abstract = {With global urbanization on the increase and cities now hosting more than half of the planet's population, there are concerns regarding the protection of urban commons as part of sustainability efforts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Decentralized urban planning is a policy tool and practice that is used to organize urban infrastructure for sustainable development. Yet, how it can be used to sustain the urban commons remains fragmented in the literature. This study reviews and synthesizes urban planning and urban commons literature using the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework and the non-cooperative game theory to identify how urban planning can protect and sustain the urban commons – green commons, land commons, and water commons – in Ghana. The study, based on the determination of different theoretical scenarios for the urban commons, identified that decentralized urban planning can help sustain the urban commons, but it is operationalized in an unfavorable political environment. For green commons, there are competing interests and poor coordination amongst planning institutions, and the absence of self-organizing bodies in managing the use of such resources. For land commons, increased land litigations are characterized by corruption and poor management of land cases in the formal land courts, and despite the existence of self-organizing institutions, these institutions have failed to act responsibly to protect land commons due to the increasing demands and values (profitability) of lands in urban areas. For water commons, urban planning has not been fully decentralized and there is also the absence of self-organizing bodies in urban water use and management. This is coupled with the waning of customary water protection provisions in urban centers. Based on the findings, the study generally proposes institutional strengthening as the bedrock for enhancing the sustainability of the urban commons through urban planning and should therefore be of policy focus moving forward.}

All this is closely linked to energy self-consumption, new management and distributed generation technologies, which are important factors in the energy transition. This new entity opens the doors to new management models, new business models and the ability to provide regulation services to the grid. This work explores all of these points, giving visibility to the wide range of opportunities offered by Energy Communities.}

Most work, however, has focused on their ability to push innovations or emerging technologies forward, emphasising their involvement in disrupting incumbent regimes or firms. However, in focusing on new entrants, often at the grassroots level, such literature runs the risk of overlooking the potentially positive role that incumbent transition intermediaries—those oriented to work with or centrally consider the interests of dominant government, market or civic stakeholders—can play in meeting sustainable energy and transport goals. In this paper, we focus specifically on five different incumbent transition intermediaries—Smart Energy GB in the United Kingdom, Energiesprong in the Netherlands, SULPU in Finland, CERTU in France, and the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association —and explain their efforts to meet socially desirable goals of accelerating innovation or decarbonizing energy or transport systems. We ask: Why were these intermediaries created, and what problems do they respond to? How do they function? What are their longer-term strategies and aspirations? In what ways do they reflect, reinforce, or otherwise shape incumbency? In answering these questions via a comparative case study approach, the paper aims to make contributions to the study of incumbency and intermediation in the context of transitions, to identifying different types of incumbent intermediaries (market, governmental, civic), and to informing debates over energy and climate policy and politics.}

We propose an integrated research frontier that examines inter-level feedback processes, the role of individuals and organizations in promoting trust within and across levels, the importance of establishing and communicating norms, and inclusion of worldviews to situate decision makers within narratives of climate change. The failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change is a social science problem, perhaps the biggest social problem our society faces. To solve it requires that we advance a new frontier on decision making across a complex set of multi-level collective action relationships.}

abstract = {The future social-technical system (STS) of power supply based on renewables depends heavily upon the rapid emergence of Distributed Energy Systems (DES). The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES. The realization of this transformation requires the escape from locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid. This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of 'socio-political acceptance' concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production within STSs applying DES. Renewables become 'common goods' in such systems, instead of 'private' or 'public' goods. Systems providing 'common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage, intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES infrastructures.}

However, lacking research can provide an overall view of the spent LIBs recycling. This study uses a systematic meta-analysis method to quantitatively analyze different independent research results. We draw the following conclusions. (1) The global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) of recycling 1 kg spent LIBs are 0.158–44.59 kg CO2-eq and 3.3–154.4 MJ, respectively. (2) There are significant differences in GWP and CED during the life cycle of LIBs recycling with different battery types, shapes, recycling processes, and electric sources. Compared with NCM batteries, the GWP and CED of recycled LFP batteries are higher. The combined hydro-pyrometallurgical process performs the best for GWP and CED, while the pyrometallurgy is the worst. The GWP of LIBs recycled by Chinese electricity is the highest, and the CED of LIBs recycled by American electricity is the highest. (3) Among the influencing factors, cascade utilization contributes the most.}

abstract = {The resource endowment characteristics of “abundant coal, scarce oil, limited methane” in China determine that coal will remain the fundamental energy source, maintaining its predominant position. Realizing the green and low-carbon operation of the precise methane extraction technology system in the entire life cycle of coal mining is one of the key tasks for the sustainable development of the coal industry. In response to the new situation requirements of the “carbon peak and carbon neutrality” background and the technical challenges of carbon emission reduction at the source of methane in coal mines, with “quality improvement and efficiency enhancement, carbon emission reduction” as the core, and “precise methane extraction, green and low-carbon” dual objectives as the guide. With “process technology and equipment intelligent innovation” as the main line, based on the technical aspects of the complete process of coal mine methane extraction, the technology system of precise methane extraction in the entire life cycle of coal mining has been actively explored and constructed. It has realized the coordinated coupling of precise methane extraction, and green and low-carbon. A carbon emission reduction technology system has been formed at the source of coal mine methane with reliable technology - low-consumption equipment - safety and intelligence. Subsequently, five key technical issues were investigated: precise prediction of methane content - methane emission volume - methane “sweet spot” resource areas, precise pre-extraction of methane in the mining coal seam by the “time-sharing + partitioning” method, precise extraction of pressure relief methane from mining by the “regional segmentation + directional” method, precise extraction of methane from the “sweet spot” resource areas in abandoned mine, and “dynamic + intelligent” precise control of coal seam methane extraction. Finally, the future development directions of the precise methane extraction technology system for coal mining throughout its life cycle under the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality” are elaborated, including the deep integration of “dynamic - transparent” coal geology and “intelligent - precise” methane pre-extraction, the deep integration of “dynamic - transparent” transport and storage area of pressure relief methane and “precise - regional segmentation” directional extraction, enhanced methane extraction technology of the methane “sweet spot” resource area through CO2 absorption and storage in abandoned mine, the integrated platform of “precise prediction - intelligent design, precise monitoring - intelligent assessment, precise diagnosis - intelligent regulation”, and “Smart+" technology combining precise methane extraction - energy saving and emission reduction for equipment - green and low-carbon for mines. By implementing the precise methane extraction technology system for the entire life cycle of coal mining under the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”, new ideas are provided for achieving methane precise extraction, green and low-carbon goals in China's coal industry.}

Urban agriculture is as a multi-functional tool to improve urban living and to provide food security towards resilient communities. This review explores on the importance of urban agriculture and identifies several points that will help inform a shift towards actively managed urban agriculture soils. First, the importance of soil within urban agriculture systems is highlighted, followed by a review of common issues of soil health in urban agriculture. These issues are then addressed by providing management principles for increased soil functioning in urban agriculture systems. These principles focus on improved soil nutrient and carbon pools and acknowledge the importance of the soil microbial community. Soil contamination with metal, organic and microbial contaminants is then addressed through a discussion of options available to help mitigate potential risk factors. Together, this review summarises our current understanding of soil health in urban agriculture systems. Where issues have been identified, these have been addressed by suggesting sustainable management principles. These can be used as recommendations for urban farmers towards more sustainable food production. Finally, we propose educational and governance approaches to help implementing these measurements.}

Despite the remarkable quantity of H2 produced by the SMR, this technology still faces major challenges such as catalyst deactivation due to the sintering of metal nanoparticles, coking, and generation of a large quantity of CO2. Firstly, the effects of catalyst types, kinetic models, and operating conditions on high-yield H2 production, the evolution path from gray to blue, via the conventional SMR are comprehensively reviewed. Secondly, exploiting intensified techniques such as membrane technology, sorption, fluidization, and chemical looping for SMR to blue H2 are discussed in detail. Further, a novel and sustainable path for the SMR process, hybridizing the use of novel materials and emerging technologies to produce turquoise H2, is proposed.

This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive literature review of the business models of 50 peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading projects around the world. The aim of this study is to explore the strengths, limitations and challenges of peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading considering its prevailing business arrangements to identify the critical requirements for its uptake in the real-world market. The findings reveal that peer-to-peer distributed renewable energy trading has characteristics of both coordinated and decentralised markets. Peer-to-peer trading is very effective when combined with value-added services such as energy storage, demand-side management, energy optimisation and information services. The key strength of peer-to-peer trading is the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to provide a secure and transparent trading environment. The main limitations to the implementation of peer-to-peer trading in the real world are the lack of regulations on trading between peers, the lack of public awareness, the complexity of the technology and the lack of government motivation. This study will enable distributed energy resources (DERs) owners, utility companies and network operators to understand how to stay relevant and competitive in peer-to-peer trading markets.}

Moreover, the integration of advanced recycling methods for conventional plastics with renewable energy, the establishment of plastic tax and credits, and the establishment of extended producer responsibility are reviewed. The success of these initiatives relies on collaboration and support from peers, industries, and consumers, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and fostering sustainable practices in plastic waste management.}

Such changes have triggered a paradigm shift in geographic information science (GIScience), as cyberspace brings new perspectives for the roles played by spatial and temporal dimensions, e.g., the dilemma of placelessness and possible timelessness. As a discipline at the brink of even bigger changes made possible by machine learning and artificial intelligence, this paper highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with geographical space in relation to cyberspace, with a particular focus on data analytics and visualization, including extended AI capabilities and virtual reality representations. Consequently, we encourage the creation of synergies between the processing and analysis of geographical and cyber data to improve sustainability and solve complex problems with geospatial applications and other digital advancements in urban and environmental sciences.}

To prevent or minimize further similar disasters we must understand the factors that have led to these catastrophic events. The causes and consequences of wildfires entail complex interactions between the biophysical and sociocultural spheres, and suitable management decisions require a sound scientific base. We present the recent panorama of increasing fire outbreaks in the Brazilian biomes, and discuss the causes that have contributed to such fires, their impacts on the environment and overall consequences for human well-being, based on reviewing the extensive specialist literature, on authors’ expert knowledge and information provided by environmental managers, researchers and politicians during a workshop organized to debate the wildfire issue in Brazil. Our up-to-date review is aimed at the academic public, environmental managers and decision- and policy-makers. First, we present evidence on the contrasting effects of fire on different ecosystems. Second, we outline the historic perceptions and policies related to fire use and management in Brazil since its colonization to the present date. Third, we propose means to advance fire prevention and develop successful management strategies. Finally, we answer frequently asked questions to clarify and/or demystify some fire-related issues not always properly addressed in the media.}

Neurotechnological devices are failing to deliver on their therapeutic promise because of the time it takes to translate them from bench to clinic. In this Perspective, we reflect on lessons learned from medical device successes and failures and consider how such lessons might shape a strategic vision for translating neurotechnologies in the future. We articulate how the intentional design and deployment of “scientific platforms,” from the technology stack of hardware and software through the supporting ecosystem, could catalyze a new wave of innovation, discovery, and therapy. We also identify specific actions that could promote future neurotechnology roadmaps and industrial-academic-government collaborative activities. We believe that community-supported neurotechnology platforms will prove to be transformational in accelerating ideas from bench to bedside, maximizing scientific discovery and improving patient care.}

abstract = {The exposure of built environment systems to climate-related disturbances increases over time. As such, the resilience of the built environment against climate change shocks and stresses has increasingly become a concern on the local, national, and global levels. Therefore, there is a need to measure the impact, build coping and adaptive capacities, and improve the functionality of the vulnerable systems. In addition, the systems must adopt the minimum resilience functioning methods and practices. Hence, this paper reviewed the most common resilience qualities (RQs), capacities, and dimensions of the built environment and their interdependencies. The research method is based on analyzing the relevant peer-reviewed journal papers published in renowned international journal papers and databases during the past two decades. The scope of the study is narrowed down by following specific guidelines to ensure a proper selection of up-to-date research articles to provide a precise understanding of the research progress on the built environment RQs. It provides an overview of the different definitions and indicators in which RQs have been applied to built environment planning, analysis, and design, emphasizing the various dimensions and relevant capacities. The study concludes that integrated resilience indicators, planning, and design methodology are crucial for incorporating RQs into the framework that influences the built environment. The built environment RQs demonstrated by this study include reflectivity (Rf), robustness (Rb), redundancy (Rd), flexibility (Fx), resourcefulness (Rs), rapidity (Rp), inclusivity (Ic), and integration (It). Nevertheless, the built environment RQs are still growing, requiring further study to develop plans and policies for effective and timely responses to climate change effects.}

For example, the surgical burden (number of surgical cases per capita) remains highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs—a term used by The World Bank to classify countries on the basis of their gross national income), where there are frequently fewer surgeons per capita. Surgical outreach is on the rise, with the United States sponsoring more than 2,000 trips annually to LMICs to help address the mismatch in per capita surgical cases to per capita surgeons. These trips, however, are typically short-term in nature and effect and can have unintended consequences. In contrast, capacity building focuses on bidirectional partnerships to educate and empower individuals and organizations such that their care for the local community is enhanced. Capacity building is a priority of leading organizations (including the World Health Organization) but has often been absent in orthopedic and hand surgery outreach. We detail the evidence supporting the transition from short-term mission-based trips to that of capacity building, what we can learn from other specialties about capacity building, and how we can measure and build capacity to improve health in LMICs using our partnership with Costa Rican hand and upper-extremity surgeons as an example.}

The empirical approach is based on a total sample of 207 articles published in the Web of Science database, which was screened in terms of title, abstract and keywords, and subject to a search protocol involving inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using VOSviewer software, a three-pronged approach is used to identify five topic clusters: (1) The impact of entrepreneurship on community sustainability and social innovation; (2) Strategic alliances for sustainable development, innovation, and performance; (3) Value creation through social entrepreneurship partnerships; (4) Challenges for knowledge-based sustainable cities; and (5) Collaboration between businesses and social enterprises; revealing the role of knowledge, co-creation, sustainable entrepreneurship, and social innovation as levers of sustainable development. As a result of this systematic literature review, a holistic research framework is proposed, positioning sustainable entrepreneurship as a priority target for strategic alliances in higher education institutions, with reference to the experience of implementing the European University concept. This framework helps to position joint cooperation and strategic alliances among the major stakeholders in knowledge-based economies, which frequently leads to knowledge-based development based on sustainable entrepreneurship.}

The Sharing City shares common discursive ground with the Sharing Economy, which is now in vogue. However, the sharing city adopts a clear human centric focus which differentiates it from other city labels or the more economic, commercial focus of previous literature on the sharing economy. The concept of the sharing city focuses, to a great extent, on how people interact with each other in order to share resources, spaces, infrastructures experiences etc within the city. Sharing city projects emphasize citizen and community participation and promote values such as social justice, well-being and sustainability. But also, by engaging in sharing practices, actors transform the city. This study analyses for first time the academic landscape of the sharing city and its social practices using a systematic literature review methodology. It is based on a systematic search of the literature in the WOS and Scopus databases resulting in the review of 80 peer-reviewed papers. Our systematic literature review shows how previous literature in this field has evolved over time. Also, it focuses on the social practices linked to the sharing city and presents in what contexts sharing in the city is taking place, what actors have led the initiatives, what disciplines have studied the sharing city and what objectives the sharing city sets. Then, gaps and future research lines are discussed. Although the sharing city has been studied mainly by certain specific disciplines, it is a concept with a multidisciplinary nature that invites new approaches and focusses. Also, implications for practitioners are suggested.}

Firstly, we conducted a narrative literature review that underlies the need of understanding the circular economy as a resilient, sustainable and circular economy, and we identified twelve principles to operationalize the circular economy under the environmental sustainability paradigm. Secondly, we created a database containing information on twenty-six strategies of circular economy. Thirdly, we analyzed the data to assess how the principles explored in phase 1 are being considered by the current circular economy strategies. Results revealed a high variability of approaches performed by the governments to reach the circular economy. Moreover, strategies grouped into the resilience domain are barely incorporated into circular economy strategies, and hence some circular economy strategies reveal shortcomings in their capacity to generate real changes. Further research is needed to perform a more holistic analysis based on complex adaptative system thinking, which would allow connecting more essential elements to enhance a socially fair development that preserves the environment.}

Following the 2018 European directive RED II, these projects have rapidly increased across the continent, showcasing their potential for creating sustainable local energy systems. While studies highlight economic, environmental, and social benefits, barriers such as regulatory challenges, finance access, and low public awareness remain. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review that explores the state-of-the-art of the academic research on energy communities. The study adopts a systematic approach to examine the body of literature on the topic to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon on the basis of rigorous and replicable research criteria. The reviewed material consists of 140 articles collected through the Scopus database, evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group the literature into analytical categories. The analysis of scientific papers published between 2018 and 2022 shows a growing attention towards Renewable Energy Communities, particularly those based on solar energy for electricity production, often combined with storage systems and heat pumps, whereas attention towards energy communities based on thermal energy production is still limited. Furthermore, most scholars focused on analysing specific territorial contexts; comparisons between different regions allows to highlight common features and elements characterizing each model. It emerged that the development of energy communities depends mainly on regulatory, financial, and managerial barriers that require an adequate institutional and legal framework capable of promoting their diffusion. Most studies address the topic from an economic perspective, often in association with incentivizing community models. However, a social perspective should be included by introducing the concept of energy sharing and methodologies for its distribution among all members of the community. The scientific community is called upon to continue investigating and supporting the development of community energy initiatives by providing evidence-based recommendations to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities. This can help to overcome existing barriers and facilitate the diffusion of energy communities models, contributing to the achievement of sustainable and inclusive energy transition goals.}

Although IoMT is involved in large-scale services provisioning in the medical paradigm; however, the resource-constrained nature of these devices makes them vulnerable to immense security and privacy issues. These vulnerabilities are not only disastrous for IoMT but threaten the whole healthcare ecosystem, which can in turn bring human lives in danger. During the past few years, threat vectors against IoMT have been evolved in terms of scalability, complexity, and diversity, which makes it challenging to detect and provide stringent defense solutions against these attacks. In this paper, we classify security and privacy challenges against different IoMT variants based on their actual usage in the healthcare domain. We provide a comprehensive attack taxonomy on the overall IoMT infrastructure comprising different device variants as well as elaborate taxonomies of security protocols to mitigate attacks against different devices, algorithms and describe their strengths and weaknesses. We also outline the security and privacy requirements for the development of novel security solutions for all the attack types against IoMT. Finally, we provide a comprehensive list of current challenges and future research directions that must be considered while developing sustainable security solutions for the IoMT infrastructure.}

Through a qualitative content analysis, we provide a framework that brings together interdisciplinary research and highlights the six main topics studied. Furthermore, we showcase two main perspectives on the topic: (i) a technical perspective that mainly focuses on making the necessary information available to all actors and (ii) a supply chain perspective that studies the impact of information sharing. We argue that for increased circularity: (i) interorganizational information sharing between business areas like manufacturing and recycling must be improved, (ii) access to information for all circular economy actors must be facilitated, and (iii) incentives for CE information sharing must be created.

Over the last three decades, the demand for various minerals has steadily increased, while the mineral processing industry has seen an unavoidable increase in the treatment of complex ores, continuous decline in plant feed grade and poor plant performance partly due to blending of ores with dissimilar properties. Despite these challenges, production plant data that are routinely generated are usually underutilised. In this contribution and aligned with the direction of the 4th industrial revolution, we highlight the value of legacy metallurgical plant data and the concept of a dry laboratory approach. This study is presented in two parts. In the current paper (Part I), a comprehensive review of the potential for the combination of modern analytical technology with data analytics to generate a new competence for process optimisation are provided. To demonstrate the value of data within the extractive metallurgy discipline, we employ data analytics and simulation to examine gold plant performance and the flotation process in two separate case studies in the second paper (Part II). This was done with the aim of showcasing relevant plant data insights, and extract parameters that should be targeted for plant design and performance optimisation. We identify several promising technologies that integrate well with existing mineral processing plants and testing laboratories to exploit the concept of a dry laboratory, in order to enhance pre-existing mineral processing chains. It also sets the passage in terms of the value of innovative analysis of existing and simulation data as part of the new world of data analytics. Using data- and technology-driven initiatives, we propose the establishment of dry laboratories and data banks to ultimately leverage integrated data, analytics and process simulation for effective plant design and improved performance.}

abstract = {New regulations allow peer-to-peer energy trading worldwide, empowering users while recognizing the prosumer as a critical stakeholder. In recent years, microgrids have surfaced as a distributed and embedded energy production alternative. This literature review analyses agent-based model systems with distinct approaches that model, control, and supervise microgrids, establishing a viewpoint for the transition to renewable energy, which engulfs energy security, and technology adoption. Procurement of microgrids utilizing energy transactions between end-users and implementing agent-based models has derived a better understanding of local and micro-energy markets. This literature review explores community microgrids deployment’s social dynamics and technical performance from a micro point of view. Finally, we present a roadmap for long and short-term use of agent-based models to access energy security via local energy markets, energy storage systems and community-based microgrids in rural areas. The results of this comprehensive review give way to further research questions on the use of agent-based models to improve the adoption of energy storage systems, the use of technologies to accelerate the creation of local energy markets, and the successful deployment of community-based microgrids.}

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of the prevailing and emergent energy communities business models, focusing on the value proposition offered by these initiatives. Community projects across Europe are analyzed and eight community business model archetypes are identified having the current European regulatory framework as background. The Business Model Canvas and the Lean Canvas frameworks are used to characterize and compare these archetypes. The main differences between business models are examined to highlight the most relevant strengths and barriers for energy community development. This analysis revealed the dominance of traditional self-consumption place-based communities, while business models involving differentiated services as demand flexibility, aggregation, energy efficiency and electric mobility are still scarce. However, the research around novel business models must be strengthened as they are expected to become crucial in upholding energy communities as key players in the energy transition and foster the regulatory framework evolution.}

The proposed recovery approach integrates technological innovations, environment, ecosystem services, “biocities,” food, rural economies, and tourism. The importance of integrating culture, arts, and the fashion industry as part of the recovery is underlined towards building a better bioeconomy that, together with environmental safeguards, promotes socio-cultural and economic innovations. This integration could be achieved supporting communities and stakeholders to diversify their activities by combining sustainable production with decarbonization, stimulating private investments in this direction and monitoring the resulting impact of mitigation measures. Food systems should become more resilient in order to allow adapting rapidly to severe crises and future shocks, while it is important to increase circularity towards the valorization of waste, the integration of different processes within the biorefinery concept and the production of bio-based products and biofuels.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly emerging technology in healthcare that has the potential to revolutionise clinical nutrition. AI can assist in analysing complex data, interpreting medical images, and providing personalised nutrition interventions for patients. Clinical nutrition is a critical aspect of patient care, and AI can help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding patients' nutritional requirements, disease prevention, and management. AI algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify novel associations between diet and disease outcomes, enabling clinicians to make evidence-based nutritional recommendations. AI-powered devices and applications can also assist in tracking dietary intake, providing feedback, and motivating patients towards healthier food choices. However, the adoption of AI in clinical nutrition raises several ethical and regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and bias. Further research is needed to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of AI-powered nutrition interventions. In conclusion, AI has the potential to transform clinical nutrition, but its integration into clinical practice should be carefully monitored to ensure patient safety and benefit. This article discusses the current and future applications of AI in clinical nutrition and highlights its potential benefits.}

As of 2021, three China state-owned electric enterprises – State Grid Corporation of China, China Southern Power Grid, and China Three Gorges Corporation – hold significant stakes in the national grids of eleven countries and territories. In this review article, we use the lens of constructivism from the international relations discipline to suggest that China's ecological civilization concept, the Global Energy Interconnection project, and the historical tributary system had rationalized these investments. China's cultural values, norms, and ideas, both historical and socially constructed by these ideational factors, shape its overseas ventures, including overseas grid investments. By doing so, we complement extant discourses on China's expansionism that are often limited to the rationales of liberal trade and world domination. While this review article extends our understanding of Chinese overseas energy investments, many unknowns remain worthy of future investigations, including how Chinese state-owned energy companies advance the three narratives in their invested power grids and how local actors perceive them.}

On the basis of evidence from the concept of transparency-by-design, we argue that transparency is facilitated by open data portals and their features enabling to work with datasets. We therefore propose the list of the categories and corresponding features of open data portals that should constitute the checklist of the portal aiming to achieve the highest level of transparency. The mapping of existing features found in literature to the phases of the transparency cycle demonstrates that open data portals meet the transparency requirements.}

A good understanding of energy systems from existing research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energy–water–land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions of energy systems. Discussions of technological innovation are grounded in optimal technology portfolio deployment and cost reduction potential, along with financial and political incentives.}

Within this proliferation, it is unclear which evidence to prioritise for action, and which research gaps, if filled, would catalyse most impact. We systematically searched for synthesis literature (i.e. reviews) related to FSNH, published after January 1, 2018. We screened and extracted characteristics of these reviews and mapped them in an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM), supplemented by expert consultation. 844 synthesis reports met inclusion criteria (from 2,739 records) and were included in the EGM. The largest clusters of reports were those describing climate impacts on crop and animal source food (ASF) production, and emissions from such (86%). Comparatively few reports assessed climate change impacts on nutrition-related health, or food manufacture, processing, storage, and transportation. Reports focused on strategies of climate adaptation (40%), mitigation (29%), both (19%) or none (12%). Only one quarter of reports critically evaluated equity (25%), and fewer reports suggested that changes to equity and equitable practices would alter climate-FSNH dynamics (6%). The expert consultation mirrored the results of the EGM, and contextualised findings further. This novel map describes a wide research landscape linking climate change to FSNH. We identified four key research gaps, including 1) Research on whole food systems or post-harvest elements 2) Research evaluating relationships between climate change and nutrition-related health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations; 3) Promising methods (and additional data required) that can a) identify inflection points or levers for intervention, b) incorporate complex dynamics and characterize trade-offs, c) be understood and applied in context-specific, localised ways for decision-making; and 4) Research undertaken through interdisciplinary collaborations that enables producing and translating evidence to action, especially those that inherently consider co-production and fairness.}

Drawing upon insights from academic and grey literature, this paper contributes to characterising the system architecture underpinning EPR. It develops a conceptual framework using a life cycle thinking process through which EPR can be analysed, agreed upon, and operationalised. Such a conceptual framework can be helpful in governmental bodies tasked with framing effective EPR policies and for industry stakeholders responsible for take-back system design and implementation.}

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and global impact on health care, and has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technology. One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger. Blockchain technology has numerous potential COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications in health care. However, much of the current research remains at the technical stage, with few providing actual clinical applications, highlighting the need to translate foundational blockchain technology into clinical use.}

It requires salient, credible, and legitimate syntheses of knowledge on recognized (or emerging) issues for public concern. Beyond the ‘instrumental’ aspects of avoidable harm (nature as protector) and cost-effective care provided to people by nature-based solutions, ‘relational values’ invoke further foundations of morality and of human priorities beyond physiological needs and primary security. Effective communication in issue-attention and policy decision cycles involves acknowledging the plurality of value perspectives and (associated) decision-making modes.

Besides price and yield incentives, agroforestry for climate change adaptation and preservation of other ecosystem services (e.g. greenhouse gas mitigation) should be promoted, while recognizing that farmer’s willingness to invest in tree planting links with informal rights for trees and customary tenure systems. Finally, extension services and communal measures that mediate overall wellbeing should be complementary measures. In conclusion, we advocate for a interdisciplinary science-based approach that respects specific contextual socio-political systems to intensify cocoa production.}

In this extensive review, we obtain 14,537 papers from the Web of Science in the relevant fields and select 1516 papers that we identify as human geography studies using GeoAI via human scanning conducted by several research groups around the world. We outline the GeoAI applications in human geography by systematically summarising the number of publications over the years, empirical studies across countries, the categories of data sources used in GeoAI applications, and their modelling tasks across different subdomains. We find out that existing human geography studies have limited capacity to monitor complex human behaviour and examine the non-linear relationship between human behaviour and its potential drivers—such limits can be overcome by GeoAI models with the capacity to handle complexity. We elaborate on the current progress and status of GeoAI applications within each subdomain of human geography, point out the issues and challenges, as well as propose the directions and research opportunities for using GeoAI in future human geography studies in the context of sustainable and open science, generative AI, and quantum revolution.}

abstract = {Urban Resilient Infrastructure (URI) has emerged as a critical factor in maintaining the equilibrium of urban systems in the face of external perturbations. URI was introduced as a promising approach for mitigating the impact of climate hazards and environmental problems. Despite its increasing importance, the existing literature on URI has inadequately provided a comprehensive understanding of the patterns governing its evolution. To address this gap, this study analyzed 958 documents on URI published between 2000 and 2022, using CiteSpace software to examine the theoretical and practical applications of URI from multiple dimensions. Our findings reveal that the field has undergone a transformation since 2016, characterized by an increasing number of publications and a shift towards a multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary approach. Researchers have expanded their focus from examining single climate disasters to evaluating the full life cycle impacts of urban ecology, social economics, and community health. The nature-based solutions cluster was the largest corpus of publications and aligns with the themes of global climate change and ecosystem services. Theoretical models such as social-economic adaptability and ecosystem restoration were the primary basis for research in this field. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence has advanced the theoretical framework and methodological approaches of URI. The utilization of complex algorithms and network analyses in the development of technical models has enabled the acquisition of sophisticated insights into the underlying mechanisms of urban resilience in diverse contexts and scenarios. The study underscored the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to urban infrastructure planning and management that considered social, economic, and environmental dimensions. It also contributed to a better understanding of the evolving field of URI and provides practical insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers interested in building more resilient and sustainable cities.}

Because buildings and cities play a substantial role in these societal challenges, we need reliable approaches that can be used to assess their resilience and sustainability. Given that building and urban systems are usually tightly coupled, we critically review nine building-scale assessment frameworks and seven urban-scale assessment frameworks, ranking them from high to low in terms of the causality among component systems. We identify four major knowledge gaps that, to varying degrees, span the entire range of assessment frameworks: (1) causality among component systems and their subsystems is limited; (2) sustainability and resilience are too narrowly defined; (3) social systems are inadequately addressed; and (4) building- and urban-scale assessments are poorly connected. To address these limitations, we briefly introduce several closely-related fields of research including integrated assessment and modeling, social-ecological systems research, land systems science, socio-environmental systems modeling, modeling of human behavior, multi-scale modeling, and multi-fidelity modeling. Building on these rapidly emerging research domains, we conclude by proposing a more holistic, multi-scale, system-of-systems approach that connects across building and urban scales using several common systems.}

The current food production system and agricultural policies rely heavily on international supply chains, creating instead a dependence on external sources for food security, while internal sources have been declining for years due to territorial food specialization and monocrops. Since the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, global supply chains have experienced unprecedented disruptions due to a combination of factors. The lack of strategic planning to ensure food security continuity in the midst of the geopolitical landscape, supply chain disruption, and soil security overlooked, significantly increase the risk of food and agricultural input shortages, price volatility, and labor disruptions affecting both industrialized and developing countries. In addition, misunderstanding, undervaluation, and underestimation of securing soil among stakeholders, policymakers and legislation are significant factors that exacerbate the problem. As a result, threats to the supply chain compromise the pillars of food security in ways that affect countries unequally, potentially leading to social instability and threatening national and international security. By treating soil as the cornerstone of national security, countries can develop coherent soil policies and strategies. This approach could lead to the development of coordinated decisions and the implementation of a global agenda for sustainable agricultural practices, improve food security, and ensure long-term stability and resilience. This article aims to examine how securing soil emerges as a pivotal strategy for ensuring food security and fostering national and international security during times of disruption.}

Likewise, the hegemonic technological-led path of development is confronted by political contestation and competing framings.

Narratives associated with regenerative agricultural systems such as agroecology and food sovereignty deserve more attention, given their significant potential social and environmental benefits. To combat the dangerous counter-narrative at all scales that productivism is ‘the solution’, it is important to frame industrial agriculture as unsustainable by design and distinguish more clearly between extractive and regenerative farming systems, in particular those capable of simultaneously sequestering more carbon, enhancing public health and promoting community well-being. Promoting this new narrative will require overcoming the lock-ins that have kept industrial agriculture alive in international policy forums focused on food security.}

We analyse trends in biodiversity commitments of the Global Fortune 100 companies and firms that have made recent ‘net impact’ commitments, evaluating alignment with these elements and where possible assessing their evolution since 2016. Uptake of biodiversity commitments has increased since 2016, but with limited progress towards adopting measurable, time-bound commitments (an increase from 5 to 10/100 Fortune 100 firms from 2016 to 2021). We review barriers to business implementation of strategies that can deliver socially equitable and ‘nature-positive’ outcomes.

The review aims at fully capturing the supporting and limiting factors for the bus fleet decarbonisation and organising them in a comprehensive taxonomy and hierarchy. Subsequently, the impact of each of the identified factors was quantitatively analysed. The results show that technological, economic and managerial factors have hampered the large-scale deployment of ZEBs, while social, environmental, and institutional dimensions have stimulated their diffusion. However, more recent studies show that advances in the technological and managerial domains are reducing some drawbacks linked to ZEBs.

However, studies addressing brownfield risks from the perspective of climate change have received limited attention. Nonetheless, the detrimental consequences of brownfield risks are intrinsically linked to strategies for mitigating and adapting to sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical importance of their far-reaching implications. This relevance extends to concerns about environmental quality, safety, health risks, and the efficacy of chosen regeneration strategies, including potential secondary pollution risks. This comprehensive review systematically surveys pertinent articles published between 1998 and 2023. A selective analysis was conducted on 133 articles chosen for their thematic relevance. The findings reveal that: (1) Under the backdrop of the climate change process, brownfield restoration is necessitated to provide scientific and precise guidance. The integration of brownfield considerations with the dynamics of climate change has progressively evolved into a unified framework, gradually shaping a research paradigm characterized by “comprehensive + multi-scale + quantitative” methodologies; (2) Research themes coalesce into five prominent clusters: “Aggregation of Brownfield Problem Analysis”, “Precision Enhancement of Brownfield Identification through Information Technology”, “Diversification of Brownfield Reutilization Assessment”, “Process-Oriented Approaches to Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Expansion of Ecological Service Functions in Brownfield Contexts”; (3) Application methodologies encompass five key facets: “Temporal and Spatial Distribution Patterns of Pollutants”, “Mechanisms and Correlations of Pollution Effects”, “Evaluation of Pollution Risks”, “Assessment of Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Integration of Brownfield Regeneration with Spatial Planning”. Future brownfield research from the climate change perspective is poised to reflect characteristics such as “High-Precision Prediction, Comprehensive Dimensionality, Full-Cycle Evaluation, Low-Risk Exposure, and Commitment to Sustainable Development”.}

Given the heterogeneity and diversity of environments and populations, we envisage these actions as a matter for the generation of new kinds of public, requiring widespread and multiple forms of engagement to generate lasting solutions.
