abstract = {Serious interoperability challenges prevent the stakeholders of infrastructure projects and citizens as the final users, from interacting with each other and helping maintain a project over its lifetime. This paper focuses on macro-scale digital twins collecting stakeholders’ feedback as the end users of the infrastructure and its service buildings. The aim is to examine various technologies for developing a CCDT and use the information processed to maintain and manage infrastructure services. This involves a systematic review, investigating technologies for data acquisition, data processing, and interface development to improve CCDT capabilities. Among the 89 selected articles, 16% of the sample dataset directly focused on users’ engagement. When considering data acquisition technologies, the open data platforms (37% of the sample dataset), remote sensors (37%), and IoT sensors (8%) ensure the dynamic capabilities of the digital twin. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) and social sensing are two prominent technologies that encourage citizen engagement. The number of articles considering the use of segmentation and classification and object detection and tracking algorithms at city-scale digital twins is significant, accounting for 25% and 24% of all articles discussing various algorithms. Further, the study carried out a comprehensive analysis of application programming interfaces (APIs) while presenting their specifications, features, and applications.}

abstract = {Recent advances in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have impacted traditional medical treatment and have evolved data communications in the Smart Healthcare scenario. Unfortunately, this also has resulted in a fertile field for attackers. As a result, traditional intrusion detection models and new detection schemes for IoMT applications have been applied. Along with it, there has been a rising trend of employing different types of artificial intelligence algorithms to improve the detection performance of attacks in medical systems communications. This paper provides a novel taxonomy of intrusion detection schemes for IoMT, which includes a comparative analysis of intrusion detection methods and an unique classification of current datasets for insights into detection performance. Additionally, we discuss the cybersecurity threats regarding the IoMT architecture and the security requirements of IoMT. Moreover, an examination of the tasks carried out in Cloud–Fog–Edge architectures, and a classification of recent literature based on the AI methods, are presented. We also discuss the legal and ethical security aspects of IoMT. Finally, we provide the challenges and novel perspectives requiring further investigation.}

abstract = {Given the global increase in crippling cyberattacks, organizations are increasingly turning to cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). CTI represents actionable threat information that is relevant to a specific organization and that thus demands its close attention. CTI efforts aim to help organizations “know their enemies better” for proactive, preventive, and timely threat detection and remediation—complementing conventional risk-management paradigms designed to improve ‘general readiness’ against known or unknown threats. Organizational security (OrgSec) and behavioral security research has lagged behind CTI's growing potential to address current cybersecurity challenges. Instead, CTI has largely been the purview of computer science from an algorithmic perspective. However, OrgSec and behavioral researchers can contribute a further combined knowledge of design for the organization, human factors, and organizational governance to foster CTI. In this theory-building and review manuscript, we propose the CTI capability model (CTI-CM) to prescribe the key capabilities necessary for a CTI practitioner to engage effectively in CTI activities. The CTI-CM defines a practitioner's CTI capability in terms of three highly interrelated but conceptually distinctive dimensions: analytical component capability, contextual response capability, and experiential practice capability. We further explain how these capabilities can be fostered, and the key implications for leading security practice in organizations.}

We adopt a three-step SLR approach to analyse/review one of the largest SLR datasets employed to-date, consisting of 140 multi-methods and theoretical CSR studies conducted globally across multiple disciplines over the 2004–2019 period, published in top-ranked journals. Our findings are as follows. First, a large number of the existing studies are descriptive and/or draw on single rather than multi-theoretical perspectives. Second, existing studies have focused mainly on how CSR is related to financial performance measures to the neglect of non-financial performance measures. Third, observable methodological limitations include the dearth of qualitative, mixed-methods and cross-cultural/developing/country studies. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research.}

Our findings demonstrate that the OI literature draws on a wide variety of mechanisms originating from the fields of management, sociology, economics, and psychology. The fifteen mechanisms most frequently observed in the literature fall into four categories: governance and policies; environmental dynamics and interactions; knowledge, skills, and capabilities; and learning by doing. Moreover, by examining the levels of analysis of these mechanisms, we observe substantial differences in how these mechanisms operate at the individual, project, firm, network, and society level. Finally, we identify various avenues for future research arising from our synthesis of the literature.}

Specifically, citation analysis identified influential papers, journals, institutions, and countries, while co-authorship analysis verified the interactions between authors, affiliations, and countries. Co-citation analysis found four hotspot clusters: prosperity and challenges in agricultural sustainability, digital information and agricultural development, innovations for sustainable agriculture, and geospatial analysis in environmental studies. The co-occurrence of keywords analysis revealed four main clusters for future studies: smart agriculture and biodiversity conservation, digitalization and sustainable agriculture, technologies and agricultural challenge management, and digital intelligence and farmer adoption. The study pioneers the use of bibliometric analysis to explore sustainable agriculture in the digital era. It presents invaluable insights into the evolving landscape of this field, summarizing its hotspots and suggesting future trajectories.}

Concepts such as Peer-to-peer energy trading (P2P), transactive energy (TE) and community/collective self-consumption (CSC) are frequently mentioned as solutions to this challenge. Despite increasing interest from industry, policy, and academia, the field lacks a shared understanding of this class of models. This need is addressed by presenting sets of shared and distinct characteristics which define P2P, TE and CSC. Our analysis is based on a series of expert group interviews with regulators, industry, and academics across 13 countries, and a systematic and targeted literature review of 133 papers. Findings show that P2P/TE/CSC models can be described as sub-markets that operate within or alongside traditional energy markets and enable trading or sharing of energy using an automated approach. They focus on promoting and supporting local energy generation and consumption using price negotiation mechanisms that reflect the aims of the market. The paper also presents sets of characteristics which differentiate P2P, TE, and CSC from one another and sets out guiding definitions to be used as a reference point. The main differences between these models stem from the goal they are trying to achieve and the contexts they are deployed in. Findings from this analysis can support development of a shared understanding of this class of models across multiple disciplinary perspectives and applications.}

We highlight major success stories associated with the potential of digital innovations to facilitate rural market transformation and support climate action, including adaptation and mitigation. Our desk and landscape review identifies various digital innovations used in Egypt, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. We then create a typology of digital innovations based on seven broad service categorizations: weather and climate; agricultural finance; energy and early warning systems; data and crowdsourcing; market information and market place; extension and advisory information; and supply chain coordination. Three technical and validation workshops supplement this review. Our review shows that digital innovations have the potential to build resilience to climate change and increase market access, but their adoption remains low and varying across contexts. Significant heterogeneity and differences exist across these countries, possibly due to different institutional and regulatory frameworks that guide demand and capacity. We identify several supply and demand-side constraints facing the digital ecosystem in the region. There is the existence of a significant digital divide fueled by gender, literacy gaps, and related socioeconomic and psychosocial constraints. A seeming disconnect also exists between pilots and scale-ups, as most existing digital applications are unsuccessful in expanding beyond the pilot phase.}

In this paper, we present a systematic review of the studies on urban disaster risk management since the Sendai Framework’s adoption in 2015 until 2022—at its midterm—identifying implementation challenges that urban digital twins can possibly address. Our study involved two stages. First, a scoping review looked at the profile of journal articles and their research trends on the topic. Second, 141 publications were selected for full-text review and synthesis within the context of the Sendai Framework priorities of action. In these studies, research on urban resilience has gained increased attention, but the importance of risk assessment is still highlighted as one of the critical process of disaster risk management. Overall, the reviewed studies reveal the complexity of disaster risk and management—requiring research considerations in different facets of: multi-dimension, multi-scale, multi-stakeholder, multi-hazard, and multi-perspective. Research directions show opportunities for urban digital twins in disaster risk management—particularly, as the integrating framework and platform of urban systems and disaster risk management processes.}

Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes. This paper pointed out the current intriguing challenges, canvassed the mitigation techniques, and plausible future research opportunities that may privilege the pursuit of this vision.}

Overall, seven key themes were identified zoonosis, emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, food safety, policy, human resources, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The majority of the included publications employed OH concepts based on the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Veterinary Medical Association definitions. We observed a common understanding of OH as an area of knowledge involving multiple disciplines and professionals and recognizing that both humans' and animals' health and the environment are interdependent. Although most authors demonstrated that health issues transcend national boundaries, a formal definition for GH was frequently not clearly identified. OH and GH interfaces are essential for accomplishing the 2030 Agenda and its SDG.}

There is a need to deepen insights on the characteristics of the emergent phenomenon of nature-based living labs, with respect to their predecessors. Accordingly, the paper first develops an outline of how living labs evolved into nature-based living labs, informed by bibliometric analysis. Second, the unique characteristics of nature-based living labs are identified using a systematic literature review. Finally, the core characteristics of living labs are determined, and nature-based living labs are placed within this context. Initial living labs had a strong technological focus, which proliferated into diverse application domains and regions after the European Network of Living Labs was established and expanded. Urban living labs emerged as a significant multidisciplinary and geographically specific domain, while nature-based living labs are inherently sustainability-oriented and consider ecosystem processes, interactions, and natural materials. Next, the paper identifies nine characteristics of nature-based living labs, five of which are always present, namely: (i) real-life spatial context and multi-scale, (ii) innovation and learning, (iii) user-centric, (iv) multi-actor involvement and (v) sustainability-oriented multiple benefits. Then, the four core characteristics of living labs, the variation within these characteristics, and how these align with the characteristics of nature-based living labs are clarified. Finally, the need for research on living labs across application domains and regions is highlighted, so that the global applicability of these local, user-centric, innovative approaches can be established.}

While the research community has provided significant effort in either BC or I4.0 research domains, the complex implications of the adoption of BC technologies in this specific context are not analyzed in depth. This is a serious drawback because of the multiple and heterogeneous interactions between participants in the production network. In fact, researchers and practitioners involved in planning and deployment of I4.0 solutions may still face questions related to the needs solved by BC, the I4.0-related adoption scenarios explored, and the Key Performance Indicators to assess the effectiveness of these technologies. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to identify shared definitions and drivers that lead to the adoption of BC technologies in I4.0. Then, we analyze several practical use cases—under the umbrella (smart) contexts of Factory, Healthcare, and Energy—highlighting the need for comprehensive analysis including not only functional and architectural characteristics but also performance. We collect a number of Key Performance Indicators and organize the dozen aliases and variants, explaining their relationships and pointing at the relevant studies. Finally, we discuss limitations, challenges and future directions related to BC application to I4.0, and the role of performance analysis in this research.}

A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent to a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Research indicates that they can substantially enhance productivity and sustainability, and are able to deal with the increasing scarcity of green labour in greenhouse horticulture. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on Digital Twin applications in greenhouse horticulture. The review identifies 8 articles that explicitly address Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture and 115 studies that implicitly apply the Digital Twin concept in smart IoT-based systems. Findings indicate that the concept of the Digital Twin is in a seminal phase in greenhouse horticulture, but there are existing applications that are not yet framed as Digital Twins. In the reviewed papers, there is a dominant focus on the cultivation process at the greenhouse level, among others for climate control, energy management and lighting. About 9% of the articles are virtualizing plants themselves, which indicates that the granularity level addressed is still rather limited. Only 7 % of the articles look beyond plants or single greenhouses. None of the reviewed articles consider the company level. Furthermore, most applications address monitoring and control of the state and behaviour of real-life objects. More advanced applications, including predictive and prescriptive capabilities across the complete lifecycle, are still in an early stage of development, although predictive Digital Twins are gaining prominence.}

abstract = {Different fields have been thriving with the advents in mobile communication systems in recent years. These fields reap benefits of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) in next generation (5G and 5BG) mobile networks. The IoT concept transforms different fields by providing large amount of data to be used in their operations. This is achieved by massively utilized sensors and mobile devices that acquire data from internet connected devices to keep track of physical systems. Hence, different use cases benefit from the data generated thanks to future mobile network systems. Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Energy, Digital Twins, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Health, Cyber Security are of significant use cases that big data plays an important role for them. Large amount of data entails more intelligent systems with respect to conventional methods, and it also entails highly reduced response time for use cases. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models are adept in satisfying the requirements of this big data situations for different use cases. In this sense, this paper provides a survey of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications for different use cases enabled by future mobile communication systems. An overview of machine learning types and artificial intelligence is presented to provide insights into the intelligent method concepts. Available studies are extensively summarized, and they are also grouped to provide a complete overview of the study. Discussions on the reviewed papers based on artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts are made, and some descriptive figures about the results of the discussions are also given in the paper. Finally, research challenges for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in the use cases are introduced, future research directions and concluding remarks are presented accordingly.}

The review focuses on how these concerns and/or practices emerge across the socio-technical narratives that characterise RES prosumers' research. The study takes stock of a machine-learning topic model and a qualitative thematic coding to identify and discuss key topics, themes, and narrative elements related to sufficiency and inclusivity in RES prosumerism. The results show a crosscutting narrative from early discussions (2005–2018) on energy citizenship, grassroots initiatives, and collective prosumer initiatives, to regulated and institutionalised energy communities (2019–2023). The narrative highlights the relational and systemic dynamics of prosumer projects, embedded in local socioeconomic, sociopolitical, and cultural contexts, and shows that inclusivity and sufficiency have not always been major concerns. However, there are exceptions found in research into “energy commons” and “grassroots innovations”. These findings are discussed in relation to the role of new policy options for sustainable RES prosumerism. The study's conclusions offer therefore policy directions for sustainable energy systems, guided by sufficiency and inclusivity principles.}

abstract = {Despite their multiple benefits and several successful case studies, water-reuse practices are still not systematically implemented Europe-wide and globally mainly owing to the lack of social trust and high governance complexity in water-reuse techniques and practices. Non-homogeneity in the water-reuse regulations is also highly relevant. To overcome these challenges, the European Parliament has recently approved the Regulation 2020/741 on minimum requirements for water reuse to standardise the legal requirements of wastewater to be considered fit for reuse. This regulation also requires elaboration of Water Reuse Risk Management Plans (WRRMPs) for all reclamation facilities of the Union. This review aims to provide a general overview of the current limitations and gaps in systematically applying water-reuse practices, as well as recommendations that could overcome them. To this end, WRRMPs and digital solutions can play a crucial role because they can ensure the safe use of reclaimed water in agriculture and support communications to stakeholders, end-users and citizens. Guidelines to develop risk management plans and the current regulations regarding water reuse in Europe have also been extensively analysed in this study together with examples of digital support to risk management in water reuse.}

Even though the integration of intelligent technologies offers unlimited potential in precision commercial agriculture, optimal resource management remains a challenge considering that IoT infrastructure is unevenly distributed across the world and concentrated in high-income countries. The utilization of IoT technologies in smart greenhouses often involves a tradeoff between the cost of agricultural production, environmental conservation, ecological degradation, and sustainability. The installation of IoT infrastructure is capital-intensive and often translates to higher energy demand, that elevates the risk for climate change. The widespread use of IoT sensors and networks also increases new challenges in the management of electronic waste, depletion of finite resources, and destruction of fragile ecosystems, resulting in climate change. the integration of IoT systems in greenhouses would be augmented by the global deployment of advanced 5G technology and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation broadband internet with low latency and high speeds. Intelligent application of agrochemicals could yield significant savings ($500/acre or more), while need-based irrigation and fertilizer application would help improve crop yields. Globally, the deployment of IoT infrastructure would yield about $500 billion of added value to the GDP by 2030. The forecasted economic benefits affirm that the applications of IoT for optimized greenhouse environment and resources management were sustainable, and any potential risks are incomparable to the long-term benefits in commercial agriculture. The review article contributes new insights on the role of IoT in agriculture 4.0, the challenges, and future prospects for developing nations, which lacked the resources to invest in precision agriculture technologies.}

While there is a common pattern of deeper dependence on the extraction of natural resources all across Latin America, a transnational and comparative analysis of the processes of politicisation of extractivism that have occurred in different countries allows for an understanding of the subtleties and differences of each form of governance of natural resources. Through a comparative analysis of different countries in the region I argue that, despite political ideologies of different governments, it is possible to observe an increasing dependence on extractivism. Such continuity has created expectations in terms of poverty, inequality and unemployment reduction, which generates popular support for extractivism. Yet, it has also led to extensive human rights violations at the local level, creating limitations for social mobilisation.}

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to examine the strategic role of world-class universities and the international academic profession in the regionalisation project of China’s Greater Bay Area (GBA). It illustrates the way in which the case of the GBA regionalisation project offers a potentially rich empirical example for adding contextual understanding to the literature of the Triple Helix model, which largely draws on inductive theorising from western successful innovation cases. The GBA regionalisation processes will provide a wealth of empirical cases for identifying circumstances that address tensions and increase interactions in the Triple Helix relationship of university, government and industry for fostering knowledge synergies.
Design/methodology/approach
Focusing on the case of Hong Kong, it engages in policy and stakeholder analysis and addresses three key research questions: What are the competitive advantages and potential strategic role of Hong Kong's universities and academic profession in the regionalisation of innovation systems in the GBA? What is the role of the governments in the regionalisation processes? What are the expected opportunities and challenges offered by the GBA policy initiatives for the future development of Hong Kong’s universities and academic profession?
Findings
Hong Kong, given its status as an international finance centre and global city with intense internationalisation and established judicial system operated by the rule of law, will contribute to the GBA development by leveraging on its edge in scientific research and development and international networks of academic research through the world-class academic profession. Scientists and researchers in the city, possessing the competitive advantages of basic research and international partnerships, are highly regarded by the central government. The engagement of Hong Kong’s scientific talents, can play an important role in achieving China’s aspiration of becoming a global technology power.
Research limitations/implications
Analysis of this article implies that the GBA concept is currently China’s ambitious but vague economic plan. The opportunities in which key node cities and knowledge/ innovation clusters will capture and capitalise from the regional ‘co-opetitive” ’entrepreneurial ecosystem are still unclear. The future of the GBA regionalisation is so dynamic and open-ended that grounded concepts related to the governance innovation/ discourse of ‘one country two systems’ and social connectedness and capitalisation with Chinese characteristics will help in making sense of the contextualisation of a Chinese regional innovation system and enhancing the sophistication of reconceptualisation of the Triple Helix model.
Originality/value
This article will add to the literature some novel contextualised knowledge about the GBA’s potential triple-helix relationship between government-university-industry in the 21st century. The empirical example of China’s GBA will also shed light on a new understanding of the role of international social capital in the entrepreneurial knowledge economy, dynamics between basic and applied research, and a synergistic interface between regionalisation and national innovation system.}

We divide the research works into four groups according to the roles that the blockchain plays in IoT systems, i.e., access control platform, data security platform, trusted third party, and automatic payment platform. For each group, we also discuss future research challenges. From the review, we further summarize the usage paradigms and open issues on using blockchain to build dependable IoT systems. We hope this work serves as a reference of existing models for both researchers and engineers that are interested to leverage blockchain to build future IoT systems.}

In this paper, we attempt to make sense of the notion of a ‘collective’ central to the STI approach. We do so by performing a literature review of 69 peer-reviewed empirical articles that specifically delve into STIs concerning energy systems and transitions. We ask how ‘collective’ or ‘collectively held imaginary’ is defined and mobilised in these studies and what methods and empirical material scholars employ to access it analytically. Our literature review reveals a predominant emphasis on national collectives, frequently serving as the primary lens for analysis, with studies also exploring the interplay between national and local/regional STIs. Beyond the nation-state, we find instances of research delving into local/regional collectives and internationally or transnationally held STIs. Moreover, we illustrate how the choice of a specific ‘collective’ entry point influences methodological choices. Drawing from our literature review, we call for a more critical and comprehensive engagement with the notion of a ‘collective’ to elucidate how and why specific STIs gain prominence and power or lose acceptance and are marginalised within various collectives, especially in the context of low-carbon energy transitions. We further urge STI scholars to focus on diverse collectives that contribute to a sense of belonging beyond the confines of scale and place, such as class, gender, race, or ethnicity. Additionally, we emphasise the role of individuals, including those less socially prominent, in (re)shaping energy imaginaries.}

The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.}

abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) is a vital addition to modern society living and is a crucial feature of the smart grid. It boosts the power system with the advantage of using intelligent infrastructure to aid monitoring, protection, bidirectional communication, supply safety, security and self-healing characteristics. ICT infrastructures are integrated into the power network by using technologies, such as active distribution networks, smart cities and societies, dynamic line ratings, special protection schemes and demand-side management programmes. Deployment of these technologies has beneficial impacts on the reliability of power systems. However, these infrastructures are naturally prone to failures and cybersecurity issues because of Internet of things standards, which can further jeopardise system reliability. Various studies have examined the effect of these technologies on the reliability of power systems whilst ignoring that the associated ICTs could be unavailable. Thus, this work comprehensively reviews studies that go beyond component-based reliability assessment and accounts for the impact of ICT integrations on system-wide reliability whilst explicitly considering the effects of malfunctions of the cyber system. Moreover, the paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about the impact of ICT deployed with various smart grid technologies and applications on the reliability of modern power systems.}

The aims and objectives of this study are threefold: to interrogate which sociotechnical concepts or tools from STS are useful at better understanding energy-related social science, to reflect on prominent themes and topics within those approaches, and to identify current research gaps and directions for the future. To do so, the study builds on a companion project, a systematic analysis of 262 articles published from 2009 to mid-2019 that categorized and reviewed sociotechnical perspectives in energy social science. It identifies future research directions by employing the method of “co-creation” based on the reflections of sixteen prominent researchers in the field in late 2019 and early 2020. Drawing from this co-created synthesis, this study first identifies three main areas of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research (sociotechnical systems, policy, and expertise and publics) with 15 topics and 39 subareas. The study then identifies five main themes for the future development of sociotechnical perspectives in energy research: conditions of systematic change; embedded agency; justice, power, identity and politics; imaginaries and discourses; and public engagement and governance. It also points to the recognized need for pluralism and parallax: for research to show greater attention to demographic and geographical diversity; to stronger research designs; to greater theoretical triangulation; and to more transdisciplinary approaches.}

Regional authorities have undertaken a number of actions in order to stimulate public-private collaboration and implementation of projects that can benefit from the EU funding aiming to accelerate the transformation of Andalusian economy and to make it more circular and less carbon intensive. While the private enterprises in the region focus mainly on recovery of agricultural and food waste, the citizen initiatives target primarily the reduction of residential waste, promoting the reutilization of furniture, home appliances and closing. Unfortunately, the initiatives of Andalusian authorities often lack harmonization with both the EU and Spanish strategies in the field. The main documents that govern the development of circular economy in the region frequently set imprecise qualitative goals, rather than binding quantitative targets to be achieved within a certain period of time. As a corollary, there is a poor coordination among the public administration, business sector and the society and insufficient provision of public funding for circular projects. We, therefore, recommend Andalusian government to build up the framework of regulatory, fiscal and economic tools that can incentivize the circular economy and to increase transparency, monitoring, reporting, and recognition of progress. It is essential to introduce both the rewarding and penalization schemes that enable behavioral changes of producers and consumers, to set the concrete numerical goals and to harmonize the main programs with the Spanish and the EU strategies in the field of circular economy.}

As countries continue to develop climate policies, in particular adaptation strategies, it is evident that these need to be articulated more effectively across multiple policy domains and jurisdictions. Climate policy integration is often sought to improve policy coherence and climate governance at different scales. The aim of this paper is to better understand to what degree climate policy integration is being achieved and what are the common barriers and enablers. Additional emphasis is placed on identifying challenges and opportunities specifically relevant to food systems and the attainment of food security goals. The study was conducted using the PRISMA Statement and four-phase diagram for reporting results of systematic reviews. The dataset analysed included 209 peer-review articles published in the period 2010−2020. The review shows that although climate policy integration is increasingly discussed as a preferred strategy to deal more effectively with complex and multiple policy domains, existing institutional and governance structures pose barriers to the effective integration of climate goals across sectors, approaches and jurisdictions. There are specific opportunities and challenges for food systems and food security. Among these opportunities are the conceptual compatibility which can be derived from land-use strategies that generate synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development goals. In addition, the agricultural sector has often developed vertical structures for the delivery of support services which can be utilized to facilitate vertical integration and implementation of strategies. In contrast, the legislative legacy and often complicated processes of policy layering, drift and conversion in land-use sectors challenge the achievement of policy coherence.}

It is therefore necessary to assess, simulate, and manage the vulnerability of desertified regions from the perspective of the social-ecological system, to support desertification control and sustainable development. This study is a systematic review of the vulnerability of the social-ecological system in desertified regions (SESDR) based on a bibliometric analysis, and a summary of the research progresses in vulnerability assessment, simulation, and sustainable management is provided. It was found that SESDR vulnerability research started relatively late, but has developed rapidly in recent years, with an emphasis on the coupling between natural systems and human activities, and multi-scale interactions and dynamics. Using various indicators at different scales, SESDR vulnerability could be assessed in terms of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability. Modeling the complex interactions among natural and human factors across multiple scales is essential to simulate the vulnerability dynamics of the SESDR. The sustainable management of SESDR vulnerability focuses on rational spatial planning to achieve the maximum benefits, with the right measures in the right places. Four priority research directions were proposed to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of vulnerability and smart restoration of desertified land. The findings of this study will enable researchers, land managers, and policymakers to develop a more comprehensive understanding of SESDR vulnerability, thereby enabling them to better address the challenges posed by complex resource and environmental issues.}

abstract = {The resource nexus consists of a framework to address interlinkages between natural resources and systems that provide water, energy, food and waste management. It transcends traditional assessments conducted in “silos”, raising trade-offs and synergies that are rarely acknowledged. The nexus framework is intrinsically context-specific, as each respective region has particularities in terms of critical interlinkages. Brazil is the world's eighth largest economy [1] and is heavily reliant on natural resources. This paper considers Brazil to be a textbook case for nexus research that identifies critical interlinkages that are neglected by literature, which is typically based on single-resource analysis. It proposes a research agenda to advance resource nexus assessments and improve resource governance in Brazil. We propose a novel method for nexus research, systematically reviewing geographical context-specific papers in relevant single nexus dimensions and establishing resource interlinkages that characterise research gaps and policy priorities. We found that 36% of practices reviewed involve more than one resource at a time, characterising interlinkages not analysed by the literature. Lastly, selected quantitative indicators were used to identify critical interlinkages by analysing the representativeness of practices in the national context, and the relevance of synergies or trade-offs for Brazil. Critical interlinkages in Brazil were found to be irrigation for energy crop expansion (water, food and energy); transport biofuels and fuelwood (water, energy, food); deforestation for new pasture (water, energy, food); and hydropower generation (water and energy). These are, therefore, priorities for future nexus research and for efforts to address synergies and trade-offs in resource governance.}

abstract = {Climate change increasingly affects agricultural systems, making it necessary for farmers to adapt to changing climatic conditions. An important element shaping farmers’ adaptation decisions and their vulnerability is their respective land tenure system. Especially land tenure security can strongly influence farmers’ incentives for adapting to climate change. We review the literature to understand to what extent tenure security and other land tenure characteristics affect farmers’ ability to withstand climate change and how climate change is operationalised. 106 mostly peer-reviewed studies are examined using thematic network analysis and a network of interactions between land tenure and climate change in farming contexts is devised. The results show that three main interactions link land tenure systems and climate change with regard to agricultural livelihoods: (i) land tenure characteristics influence farmers’ adaptation uptake, type and intensity, (ii) certain tenure settings contribute to vulnerability of different socio-demographic groups in agricultural systems, e.g. women, migrants and indigenous communities, and (iii) the perception of tenure security itself is affected by climate change. Yet, the concept of tenure security is poorly defined in most studies, at times resulting in misleading conclusions and leaving important research gaps with regard to optimal land tenure incentives for farmers’ adaptation response. Climate change is often simplistically integrated into the assessments, without validation and analysis of longer term trends. None of the studies reviewed provides a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the multiple dimensions linking climate change and land tenure. Further exploration and empirical validation of the connection between land tenure and climate change in agricultural systems is thus warranted. This should include a more critical engagement with the exigencies of climate change response for agricultural systems, such as the need for flexible approaches to deal with climatic uncertainty. The results of this review are relevant for informing adaptation policy, where sustainable land governance has an integral role to play. Designing smart land tenure interventions based on improved understanding of (local) interactions between land tenure and climate can support farmers in effectively addressing the adverse effects of climate change.}

abstract = {Objective
This review aimed to examine how mobile health (mHealth) to support integrated people-centred health services has been implemented and evaluated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR).
Methods
Eight scientific databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in title and abstract stages, followed by full-text appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis of eligible studies. Studies were extracted to capture details of the mhealth tools used, the service issues addressed, the study design, and the outcomes evaluated. We then mapped the included studies using the 20 sub-strategies of the WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS); as well as with the RE-AIM (Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework, to understand how studies implemented and evaluated interventions.
Results
We identified 39 studies, predominantly from Australia (n = 16), China (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 4) and New Zealand (n = 4), and little from low income countries. The mHealth modalities included text messaging, voice and video communication, mobile applications and devices (point-of-care, GPS, and Bluetooth). Health issues addressed included: medication adherence, smoking cessation, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, and lifestyle activities respectively. Almost all were community-based and focused on service issues; only half were disease-specific. mHealth facilitated integrated IPCHS by: enabling citizens and communities to bypass gatekeepers and directly access services; increasing affordability and accessibility of services; strengthening governance over the access, use, safety and quality of clinical care; enabling scheduling and navigation of services; transitioning patients and caregivers between care sectors; and enabling the evaluation of safety and quality outcomes for systemic improvement. Evaluations of mHealth interventions did not always report the underlying theories. They predominantly reported cognitive/behavioural changes rather than patient outcomes. The utility of mHealth to support and improve IPCHS was evident. However, IPCHS strategy 2 (participatory governance and accountability) was addressed least frequently. Implementation was evaluated in regard to reach (n = 30), effectiveness (n = 24); adoption (n = 5), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 1).
Conclusions
mHealth can transition disease-centred services towards people-centred services. Critical appraisal of studies highlighted methodological issues, raising doubts about validity. The limited evidence for large-scale implementation and international variation in reporting of mHealth practice, modalities used, and health domains addressed requires capacity building. Information-enhanced implementation and evaluation of IPCHS, particularly for participatory governance and accountability, is also important.}

The competency-based undergraduate curriculum reform at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Faculty of Medicine (UMP-FM) is detailed and reviewed in reference to the instructional and institutional reforms, and enabling actions recommended by the Lancet 2010 Commission for Health Professional Education. Key objectives are to: revise the overall 6-year curriculum to be more integrated and competency-based; reinforce students’ knowledge application, problem-solving, clinical competence, self-directed learning and soft skills; develop a comprehensive and performance-based student assessment programme; and establish a comprehensive quality monitoring programme to facilitate changes and improvements. New features include early introduction to the practice of medicine, family- and community-based medicine, professionalism, interprofessional education, electives experiences, and a scholarly project. Institutional reform introduces a faculty development programme, joint planning mechanism, a “culture of critical inquiry”, and a transparent faculty reward system. Lessons learnt from the curriculum reform at UMP-FM could be helpful to medical schools from low- and middle-income countries considering transitioning from a traditional to a competency-based curriculum.

abstract = {The construction industry plays a critical role in Circular Economy (CE) transition because of its significant resource intensity. However, construction CE is limited due to its unique industrial characteristics and the complex nature of CE. To tackle wicked CE challenges, Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) are recognised as promising solutions since they provide potential support to CE-oriented decision-making. However, the effectiveness and challenges of applying ICT to a broader decision-making context to implement CE in the built environment remain unexplored. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive overview of ICT-based decision support tools applied to implement construction CE. Through a systematic literature review, 62 papers published during 2010–2021 are selected, categorised, and analysed. First, the state-of-the-art of these tools is described. Then, a theoretical framework is proposed to articulate the mechanism of how ICT-based tools support circular construction/demolition practices throughout the building life-cycle. The research and development of ICT-based decision support tools are vital to successful construction CE implementation. However, scant attention has been devoted to integrating relevant technologies in a comprehensive information system by considering the complex landscape of CE. Based on critical literature analysis, challenges of applying ICT to support CE are identified from technology, business, and societal perspectives. Furthermore, recommendations for future research directions are provided including the conceptual reference architecture of a Circularity Information Platform that demonstrates the desirable technology integration. We encourage more interdisciplinary research to contribute to the development of a new research paradigm: Smart Circular Construction Ecosystems.}

However, traditional ML solutions operate on centralized data collection and processing. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution to train ML models on multiple decentralized devices without effectively sharing private data. Therefore, FL offers a secure architecture to handle highly sensitive data in the IoHT context. This survey comprehensively reviews emerging data security and privacy applications for FL in IoHT networks. First, we present a background overview of the basic concepts of FL applied in IoHT. In particular, we rigorously investigate and evaluate the main solutions to IoHT data security and privacy issues. In addition, we categorize the most relevant publications related to IoHT data security, whether due to advances in the architecture of FL or data protection. Next, we list several IoHT network datasets for model training. Finally, we highlight the essential lessons from this review, highlighting current challenges and possible directions for future research in data security and privacy in IoHT networks using FL.}

The recent shockwaves from the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have made nations rethink their energy transition strategies. For various governments to encourage carbon neutrality, there is a dire necessity for widespread research on the expansion of greener energy sources. This bibliometric review sheds light on the significant contributions in the field of energy transition research in the past four decades and suggests future research roadmaps. By compiling a map of scholarly publications on energy transition, this study uses the PRISMA technique and bibliometric software like VOS-viewer, cite-space, and R-Biblioshiny to map the research findings of scholarly publications listed in Scopus and Web of Science during 1981–2021. Our analysis shows that aspects like climate change, alternative energy, governance approach, and emission reduction are increasingly important. Further, areas that require future research include developing policy frameworks, energy infrastructure (storage and transfer), renewable energy ecosystem, clean energy economic analysis, and impact assessment for timely energy transition across the globe. Therefore, collaboration among nations and research institutions should be advanced with a particular focus on clean technology development and knowledge transfer for rapid energy transition across continents.}

abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.}

Over the past five years, there has been significant growth in the amount of academic literature examining how these local energy markets might function. This systematic literature review of 139 peer-reviewed journal articles examines the market designs used in these energy trading models. A modified version of the Business Ecosystem Architecture Modelling framework is used to extract market model information from the literature, and to identify differences and similarities between the models. This paper examines how peer-to-peer, community self-consumption and transactive energy markets are described in current literature. It explores the similarities and differences between these markets in terms of participation, governance structure, topology, and design. This paper systematises peer-to-peer, community self-consumption and transactive energy market designs, identifying six archetypes. Finally, it identifies five evidence gaps which require future research before these markets could be widely adopted. These evidence gaps are the lack of: consideration of physical constraints; a holistic approach to market design and operation; consideration about how these market designs will scale; consideration of information security; and, consideration of market participant privacy.}

However, energy resilience is at its pregnancy stage with inconsistency in multiple perspectives, ranging from concept definition to quantification approach. Moreover, the consideration of energy resilience will conflict with energy efficiency, calling for the necessity on trade-off solutions. In this study, in order to ensure the survivability of district power systems when suffering from extreme events, an up-to-date review on concept definition and quantification approach of energy resilience was conducted, together with distinguished boundary and correlation with reliability, robustness, and flexibility in multi-energy systems. Recent advancement in distributed renewable systems, electric vehicles, peer-to-peer energy sharing, electrification and hydrogenation in power systems was provided, together with their potential contributions in future smart energy systems. By enabling each agent to become a power supply agent, a typology transformation from centralized to distributed energy prosumers was proposed, with an intermediate step-by-step transition from centralized power plants to distributed energy prosumers. Afterwards, multi-scale applications and future prospects of energy resilience are provided, including resilient heating/cooling of buildings, dynamical downscaling for robust design on urban morphology, mobility-based interactive energy sharing in regional districts, and smart microgrids with V2X (vehicle-to-everything) and energy flexible buildings. This study can highlight the significance in district energy resilience with joint and continuous endeavors and tradeoff solutions, during energy planning, design and operation stages.}

As such, the paper provides a critical review of existing technologies and con-cepts that promote and contribute to the decarbonisation of seaports, including Smart Grids and Virtual Power Plants. Several avenues for future research are then discussed, including (a) total life cycle approach to seaport energy manage-ment, (b) Semantic-based modelling, forecasting and optimisation of seaports energy systems, (c) Secure and reliable seaports energy services, and (d) Transi-tion towards prosumer-driven seaport energy communities.

In this context, resilience-building represents a relevant challenge for urban managers, mainly due to the barriers to integrating diverse infrastructure subsystems at different governance levels. Thus, this study aims to analyze risk management tools' contribution to urban infrastructure services' resilient planning. The research developed risk management tools that were incorporated into the decision-making process of resilient urban planning. The tools were applied to a case study in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, relating characteristics of its infrastructure to operationalization principles of urban resilience in the literature. The results revealed that the risk management tools could promote a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and threats of the infrastructure network under climate risks, based on the technical experience and engagement of multiple stakeholders in decision making. Local management experiences demonstrate no single way to strengthen resilient characteristics in cities. Instead, the analyses developed supported a greater understanding of the risk management tools' potential for resilient planning, admitting uncertainties in the transition to responsive and adaptive urban ecosystems.}

However, because of the technology's recentness, there are only a few available collections with a lack of extensive testing in industrial blockchain applications. It is also difficult for software architects to adequately apply blockchain patterns in their applications, as it requires deep knowledge of blockchain technology. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has identified 120 unique blockchain-related patterns and proposes a pattern taxonomy composed of multiple categories, built from the extracted pattern collection. The purpose of this collection is to map, classify, and describe all the available patterns across the literature to help readers make adequate decisions regarding blockchain pattern selection.

Based primarily on qualitative research interviews and focus groups in five countries—Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and a comprehensive literature review, the study assess stakeholder perceptions of primary and secondary business models for V2G. It identifies at least twelve meaningful stakeholder types and corresponding business markets: automotive manufacturers, battery manufacturers, vehicle owners, energy suppliers, transmission and distribution system operators, fleets, aggregators, mobility-as-a-service providers, renewable electricity independent power providers, public transit operators, secondhand markets and secondary markets. These business models fall into the five clusters of equipment, grid services, aggregation, bundling, and secondary markets.

We conducted a semi-systematic review to define a ‘spatially just’ low carbon transition, considering how spatial dimensions are explicitly or implicitly presented in assessments of the LCT, and the policy and governance approaches that could embed spatial justice. A sample of 75 academic articles was thematically coded. Spatial justice involves the fair distribution of both benefits and burdens associated with LCTs, and this often creates problems of equity given the geographic gap between regions that ‘win and lose’. The studies point to a research gap in exploring fairness implications that go beyond the employment impacts of transition. Acceptance of the LCT is shown to be contingent on perceptions of justice, particularly whether the most responsible and capable actors are taking action. There is similar concern that the LCT may not address, or may reproduce, existing patterns of injustice. This is particularly the case in terms of spatially inequitable land uses and where historic planning policy has had lasting socioeconomic impacts. Policy challenges to making LCTs more spatially just included administrative fragmentation across spatial scales and the lack of coordination in net zero policy. We identify that future transition policymaking could benefit from using spatially targeted interventions, and in adopting a whole systems approach. In this recognition of the multiple economic vulnerabilities of different regions, LCT policymaking can become both more effective and, critically, more just.}

We assess the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in the water sector at the global scale using two examples: strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in rural areas (e.g. drip irrigation, watershed management), and sustainable water management in urban areas (e.g. flood management, upgrading sewage systems). To contextualise the assessment and showcase how adaptation feasibility is regionally differentiated, we present two case studies: flood management in Jakarta and Rotterdam; and community-based watershed management in India and the Dry Corridor of Central America, specifically Guatemala and Honduras. The assessment highlights that while improving irrigation efficiency is technically feasible and has economic benefits, it is constrained by issues of replicability and trade-offs across scale and institutional barriers. In urban areas, flood management measures are technologically and geophysically feasible but barriers such as inadequate institutional capacities constrain their feasibility. We also assess mitigation and sustainable development synergies and trade-offs for the two adaptation options. The findings on factors constraining adaptation feasibility in the water sector are useful for policymakers who are increasingly faced with a diverse suite of adaptation choices.}

abstract = {Blockchain quickly became an important technology in many applications of precision agriculture discipline. The need to develop smart P2P systems capable of verifying, securing, monitoring, and analyzing agricultural data is leading to thinking about building blockchain-based IoT systems in precision agriculture. Blockchain plays the role of pivotal in replacing the classical methods of storing, sorting and sharing agricultural data into a more reliable, immutable, transparent and decentralized manner. In precision farming, the combination of the Internet of Things and the blockchain will move us from only smart farms only to the internet of smart farms and add more control in supply-chains networks. The result of this combination will lead to more autonomy and intelligence in managing precision agriculture in more efficient and optimized ways. This paper exhibits a comprehensive survey on the importance of integrating both blockchain and IoT in developing smart applications in precision agriculture. The paper also proposed novel blockchain models that can be used as important solutions for major challenges in IoT-based precision agricultural systems. In addition, the study reviewed and clearly discussed the main functions and strengths of the common blockchain platforms used in managing various sub-sectors in precision agriculture such as crops, livestock grazing, and food supply chain. Finally, the paper discussed some of the security and privacy challenges, and blockchain-open issues that obstacles developing blockchain-IoT systems in precision agriculture.}

In particular, sixteen planetary health drivers are identified, i.e., population growth, climate change, agricultural intensification, urbanization, land use and land cover change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, globalization, wildlife trade, wet markets, non-planetary health diet, antimicrobial resistance, air pollution, water stress, poverty and weak governance. The implications of COVID-19 for planetary health are grouped in six categories: social, economic, environmental, technological, political, and public health. The implications for planetary health are then judged to see the impacts with respect to sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Therefore, enhancing sustainability within this sector has become of paramount importance. A crucial step towards achieving this goal involves the definition and implementation of effective sustainability metric and measurements. In this regard, the adoption of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods can be seen as one of the most suitable and promising approach to comprehensively capture the complex and broad-ranging effects of agricultural practices and food supply chains. In such context, a systematic review of the scientific literature on multi-criteria approaches and tools for measuring the sustainability of food supply chains (harvest and post-harvest stages) has been carried out, resulting in the selection and analysis of 42 articles. To delve into the selected articles, three main areas of focus have been identified. The first about MCDA methods and their features, revealing the most adopted methods for sustainability assessments of food supply chains. The second, focusing on the participatory approach, led to the definition of a stakeholder's engagement map, highlighting the typology of stakeholders involved, the reasons of their involvement and engagement methods. Lastly, the third focus is related to the analysis and classification of indicators adopted in each study and the sustainability dimensions to which they refer to. The results of the present review study provide a comprehensive overview of the essential aspects to be considered when developing a MCDA for sustainability assessment in the food sector, serving as a valuable resource for both scholars and practitioners.}

abstract = {The health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is rapidly declining, driven by multiple stressors including land-based impacts on water quality. For over fifteen years Australian Governments have been investing in programs to promote the voluntary adoption of agricultural practices that reduce nutrient, pesticide and sediment runoff. Insights from monitoring, modelling and research have been used to progressively refine and focus investments over time. Despite this, progress is clearly inadequate to achieve the ambitious program targets. More recently, policy makers have introduced new targets to enhance the active engagement of communities and land managers in programs to improve water quality outcomes. In this review article, we draw on the empirical evidence from the social science literature available from studies within the Great Barrier Reef catchments and consider implications for the current approach being used in Reef programs. Adopting a qualitative evidence synthesis approach, the review examines a nested set of themes: from landholder decision making on practice adoption; participation and engagement in programs; and the influence of the broader policy settings and instruments to deliver government plans and investment. The review highlights the influence of factors such diverse landholder goals and motivations, social and cultural risks of participation, and the benefits of knowledge exchange over knowledge transfer in building trust and commitment amongst landholders. The review also highlights the importance of maintaining collaboration and capacity in industry and natural resource management networks, and, committing to active experimentation and learning at both the farm and program levels. Critical knowledge gaps include the potential for greater participation of supply chain and private actors in program delivery, including exploring the efficacy of ‘smart’ regulation responses, and the impact of re-emergent place-based models for implementation.}

abstract = {Public concern over environmental issues such as ecosystem degradation is high. However, restoring coupled human-natural systems requires integration across many science, technology, engineering, management, and governance topics that are presently fragmented. Here, we synthesized 544 peer-reviewed articles published through September 2020 on the desiccation and nascent recovery of Lake Urmia in northwest Iran. We answered nine questions of scientific and popular interest about causes, impacts, stabilization, recovery, and next steps. We find: (1) Expansion of irrigated agriculture, dam construction, and mismanagement impacted the lake more than temperature increases and precipitation decreases. (2) Aerosols from Lake Urmia's exposed lakebed are negatively impacting human health. (3) Researchers disagree on how a new causeway breach will impact salinity, evaporation, and ecosystems in the lake's north and south arms. (4) Most researchers tried to restore to a single, uniform, government specified lake level of 1274.1 m intended to recover Artemia. (5) The Iranian government motivated and funded a large and growing body of lake research. (6) Ecological and limnological studies mostly focused on salinity, Artemia, and Flamingos. (7) Few studies shared data, and only three studies reported engagement with stakeholders or managers. (8) Researchers focused on an integration pathway of climate downscaling, reservoirs, agricultural water releases, and lake level. (9) Numerous suggestions to improve farmer livelihoods and governance require implementation. We see an overarching next step for lake recovery is to couple human and natural system components. Examples include: (a) describe and monitor the system food webs, hydrologic, and human components; (b) adapt management to monitored conditions such as lake level, lake evaporation, lake salinity, and migratory bird populations; (c) improve livelihoods for poor, chronically stressed farmers beyond agriculture; (d) manage for diverse ecosystem services and lake levels; (e) engage all segments of society; (f) integrate across restoration topics while building capacity to share data, models, and code; and (g) cultivate longer-term two-way exchanges and public support. These restoration steps apply in different degrees to other Iranian ecosystems and lakes worldwide.}

Using exploratory factor analysis, six distinct research streams are identified: I. energy market innovation and transformation (through blockchain technology), II. blockchain for data sharing and security, III. energy management in smart grids and scalable systems, IV. information transmission across networks and its applications, V. peer-to-peer energy microgrids, and VI. potential of blockchain technology. For each of these streams, the highest-impact articles are reviewed. In addition, social network analysis allows to reveal the relationships and dependencies between the streams. The results indicate a high degree of homogeneity in this field of research, as the six streams explain more than 71% of variance. The degree to which the streams are centered on blockchain technology varies. While the two most established discourses and the least established one focus at least in part on blockchain, the other three streams prioritize energy issues. It is postulated that specific research fields on this topic are only beginning to emerge, implications are discussed and areas for future research are derived.}

This paper unpacks the cybersecurity threat landscape of DT technologies for GCFs – as central organizations in the delivery of built infrastructure – through a critical synthesis of literature with emphasis on the cyber, physical, and social dimensions. It reviews common cyber vulnerabilities and threats linked to DTs and provides a cross-industry vulnerability analysis for GCFs in a sector known for a laissez-faire approach to cybersecurity. Vulnerabilities are categorized into a cyber, physical, and social taxonomy for construction, and four propositions for future considerations are developed.}

The world continues to experience a surge in data generation and digital transformation. Historic data is increasingly being replaced by modernized data, such as big data, which is regarded as data that exhibits the 5Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value. The capacity to optimally use and comprehend value from big data has become an indispensable aptitude for modern companies. In contrast to commercial and technology firms, usage, management and governance of data, including big data is a novel and evolving trend for mining and mineral industries. Although the mining industry can be unenthusiastic to change, embracing modernized data and big data is evolutionarily unavoidable, given many industry-wide challenges (i.e., fluctuation in commodity prices, geotechnical and harsh ground conditions, and ore grade), which corrode revenues and increase business risks, including the possibility of regulatory non-compliance. The minerals industry holds a genuine gold mine of data that were collected for scientific, engineering, operational and other purposes. Data and data-centric workspaces that are targeted towards innovation and experimentation, which if combined with in-discipline expertise are two harmonious ingredients that can provide many practical solutions for the mining and mineral industries. In this paper, the concept, the opportunity and the necessity for a move towards a technology- and innovation-based, data-centric ‘dry laboratories’ (common workspaces that facilitates data-centric experimentation and innovation) in the minerals industry are assessed. We contend that the dry laboratory environment maximizes the value of data for the minerals industry. Toward the establishment of dry laboratories, we propose several essential components of a framework that would enable the functionality of dry laboratories in the minerals industry, while concomitantly examining the components from both academia and industry perspectives.}

abstract = {To facilitate the rapid and large-scale developments of offshore wind energy, scholars, policymakers and infrastructure developers must start considering its integration into the larger onshore energy system. Such offshore system integration is defined as the coordinated approach to planning and operation of energy generation, transport and storage in the offshore energy system, across multiple energy carriers and sectors. This article conducts a systematic literature review to identify infrastructure components of offshore energy system integration (including alternative cable connections, offshore energy storage, and power-to-hydrogen applications) and barriers to their development. An interdisciplinary perspective is provided where current offshore developments require not only mature and economically feasible technologies, but equally strong legal and governance frameworks. The findings demonstrate that current literature lacks a holistic perspective on the offshore energy system. To date, techno-economic assessments solving challenges of specific infrastructure components prevail over an integrated approach. Nevertheless, permitting issues, gaps in legal frameworks, strict safety and environmental regulations, and spatial competition also emerge as important barriers. Overall, this literature review emphasizes the necessity of aligning various disciplines to provide a fundamental approach for the development of an integrated offshore energy system. More specifically, timely policy and legal developments are key to incentivize technical development and enable economic feasibility of novel components of offshore system integration. Accordingly, to maximize real-world application and policy learning, future research will benefit from an interdisciplinary perspective.}

Protecting endangered species is also supported by the public and judiciary. Yet, despite what appear as enabling conditions, wild species continue to decline. Our paper explores pathways to endangered species recovery by analyzing the barriers that have been identified in Canada, the United States, and Australia. We summarize these findings based on Canada’s Species at Risk Conservation Cycle (assessment, protection, recovery planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation) and then identify 10 “bridges” that could help overcome these barriers and bend our current trajectory of wildlife loss to recovery. These bridges include ecosystem approaches to recovery, building capacity for community co-governance, linking wildlife recovery to ecosystem services, and improving our storytelling about the loss and recovery of wildlife. The focus of our conclusions is the Canadian setting, but our findings can be applied in other national and subnational settings to reverse the decline of wildlife and halt extinction.}

abstract = {Livestock products share more than fifteen percent of total agri-foods traded worldwide. A global increase in food demand has increased the risk to food safety. Improvements in food quality, cold chain transit, and preservation are required for safe livestock products. Though, the food safety and regulation authorities demand complete food traceability from farm to fork, but in traditional supply chain it is ignored by fiddling with the transit paperwork and bill invoices. The process of supply chain reformation and activities linked to food recalls during food safety issues are insanely expensive and challenging. Traceability-driven food supply chain management is likely to implement novel technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). The capability of the Blockchain era within the food sector is emerging with use cases across different regions, as shown via the growing number of studies. Credibility, efficiency, and safety are all improved when food products can be instantly traced from their point of origin through all points of contact on their way to the consumer. Blockchain assures a tamper-proof and transparent system that allows an innovative business solution, together with smart contracts. However, there are significant difficulties with the implementation of blockchain technology for food traceability. It necessitates more and more training platforms as well as trainers, who can make understanding and operability of this technology easy among ground-level participants and food entities. For the tactical application of this technology, it is essential to comprehend the legal and regulatory framework.}

Forests play a key role in a bio-based economy by providing renewable materials, mitigating climate change, and accommodating biodiversity. However, forests experience massive increases in stresses in their ecological and socioeconomic environments, threatening forest ecosystem services supply. Alleviating those stresses is hampered by conflicting and disconnected governance arrangements, competing interests and claims, and rapid changes in technology and social demands. Identifying which stresses threaten forest ecosystem services supply and which factors hamper their alleviation requires stakeholders' perceptions. Stakeholder-oriented stress tests for the supply of forest ecosystem services are therefore necessary but are not yet available. This perspective presents a roadmap to develop a stress test tailored to multiple stakeholders' needs and demands across spatial scales. We provide the Cascade and Resilience Rosetta, with accompanying performance- and resilience indicators, as tools to facilitate development of the stress test. The application of the stress test will facilitate the transition toward a bio-based economy in which healthy and diverse forests provide sustainable and resilient ecosystem services.}

However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.}

Methods applied involved five stages: (1) a theoretical framework of hospital sector reforms was developed; (2) basic quantitative data characterizing hospital sectors were compared; (3) a scoping review was performed to identify an initial list of reforms per country; (4) the list was sent to national researchers who described the top three reforms based on a standardized questionnaire; (5) received questionnaires were analysed and validated with available literature. Results indicate that the scope of conducted reforms is very broad. Yet, reforms related to hospital sector governance and changes in purchasing and payment systems are much more frequent than reforms concerning relations with other providers. Most governance reforms aimed at transforming hospital infrastructure, improving financial management and/or improving quality of care, while purchasing and payment reforms focused on limiting hospital activities and/or on incentivising a shift to ambulatory/day care. Three common challenges included the lack of a comprehensive approach; unclear outcomes; and political influence. Given similar reform areas across countries, there is considerable potential for shared learning.}

Based on panel data from 292 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021, this study discusses the spatial effects and mechanisms of the digital economy on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. The study found that: (1) The digital economy has direct and indirect influences on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. The digital economy can drive reductions in pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions by upgrading industrial structures and transforming energy structures. (2) Green innovation plays an active regulatory role in the digital economy and structural optimization, particularly in the context of SCEPCE. This interference helps mitigate the impact of the digital economy on pollution and carbon emissions. (3) The digital economy has a significant spatial spillover effect on the coordinated control of pollutants and carbon emissions. (4) The influence mechanism of the digital economy on pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergy exhibits geographical heterogeneity, resource endowment heterogeneity. To enhance the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, it is essential to bolster support and optimise the digital economy at various levels. This includes reinforcing regional balance, considering spatial spillover effects, and enhancing the leading role of developed cities in the region.}

This paper performs a holistic analysis of artificial intelligence applications to distribution networks, ranging from operation, monitoring and maintenance to planning. The potential artificial intelligence techniques for power system applications and needed data sources are identified and classified. The following data-driven services for distribution networks are analyzed: topology estimation, observability, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, non-technical losses detection, forecasting, energy management systems, aggregated flexibility services and trading. A review of the artificial intelligence methods implemented in each of these services is conducted. Their interdependencies are mapped, proving that multiple services can be offered as a single clustered service to different stakeholders. Furthermore, the dependencies between the AI techniques with each energy service are identified. In recent years there has been a significant rise of deep learning applications for time series prediction tasks. Another finding is that unsupervised learning methods are mainly being applied to customer segmentation, buildings efficiency clustering and consumption profile grouping for non-technical losses detection. Reinforcement learning is being widely applied to energy management systems design, although more testing in real environments is needed. Distribution network sensorization should be enhanced and increased in order to obtain larger amounts of valuable data, enabling better service outcomes.

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to transform health systems to improve the quality of healthcare services. However, AI is still new in Tanzania, and there is limited knowledge about the application of AI technology in the Tanzanian health sector.
Objectives
This study aims to explore the current status, challenges, and opportunities for AI application in the health system in Tanzania.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Extensions for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). We searched different electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, African Journal Online, and Google Scholar.
Results
Eighteen (18) studies met the inclusion criteria out of 2,017 studies from different electronic databases and known AI-related project websites. Amongst AI-driven solutions, the studies mostly used machine learning (ML) and deep learning for various purposes, including prediction and diagnosis of diseases and vaccine stock optimisation. The most commonly used algorithms were conventional machine learning, including Random Forest and Neural network, Naive Bayes K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic regression.
Conclusions
This review shows that AI-based innovations may have a role in improving health service delivery, including early outbreak prediction and detection, disease diagnosis and treatment, and efficient management of healthcare resources in Tanzania. Our results indicate the need for developing national AI policies and regulatory frameworks for adopting responsible and ethical AI solutions in the health sector in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance on ethics and governance of AI for health.}

This paper surveys the conventional disaster governance regimes and examines whether a sustainable and resilient society against natural and human-induced disasters can be built. This paper aims to shed light on resilient city and country building from the perspective of disaster prevention. Current disaster strategies must be updated in order to mitigate the cost of disaster events and to make people happy. This paper quantifies the scores of the COVID-19 policies for strengthening disaster prevention technology.}

abstract = {This paper asserts that the value of a mining region does not only depend on the economic benefits from mining activity, but also on its geological, environmental, social and cultural values. Values and vulnerabilities evolve over the mine life cycle, forming specific territorial trajectories that depend on the initial conditions as well as on political, economic, and socio-cultural contexts. A simple graphical framework is proposed to represent and describe the changing values and vulnerabilities over the mine life cycle. This framework, which has been developed for industrial metal mines, is applicable whatever the spatial scale considered and emphasises the complexity of territorial trajectories in relation to local governance and policies. It allows for easy comparison of mining regions. Future work should focus on defining integrative indexes for the different types of territorial values and vulnerabilities.}

abstract = {Irrigated agriculture in Pakistan provides food and livelihood security for about 220 million people, mostly living in Punjab and Sindh provinces. This review paper explains the institutional arrangements for water supply and on-farm water management along with their roles. Successful elements covering decades of efforts have also been studied. The implications of less profitability of the farming business are also identified. This paper articulates multiple investments for irrigation infrastructure expansion, on-farm water management, and promotion of resource conservation technologies including public sector demonstration and research projects, cost-sharing/subsidized schemes, and technology introduction with associated training and learning approaches. This draws a clear picture of present-day agriculture and has helped in identifying cracks in the implementation of these practices that need mending for more definitive outcomes. These efforts have resulted in considerable enhancements including, increasing water availability, cropped areas and cropping intensity, promotion of resource conservation technologies, and farm mechanization. Despite these attempts, farming is no more a profitable business for the majority of farmers while water productivity remains the lowest in the region. There is a constant decline of the share of agriculture sector and labor in gross domestic product of the country. The divide between on-farm water management and irrigation departments, requires formulation of a new governance model keeping in view the past experiences to make farming a profitable business.}
