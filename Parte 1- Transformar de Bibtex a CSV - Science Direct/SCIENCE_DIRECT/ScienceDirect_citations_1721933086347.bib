abstract = {Tropical rainforests of Latin America (LATAM) are one of the world's largest carbon sinks, with substantial future carbon sequestration potential and contributing a major proportion of the global supply of forest carbon credits. LATAM is poised to contribute predominantly towards high-quality forest carbon offset projects designed to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, halt biodiversity loss, and provide equitable conservation benefits to people. Thus, carbon markets, including compliance carbon markets and voluntary carbon markets continue to expand in LATAM. However, the extent of the growth and status of forest carbon markets, pricing initiatives, stakeholders, amongst others, are yet to be explored and extensively reviewed for the entire LATAM region. Against this backdrop, we reviewed a total of 299 articles, including peer-reviewed and non-scientific gray literature sources, from January 2010 to March 2023. Herein, based on the extensive literature review, we present the results and provide perspectives classified into five categories: (i) the status and recent trends of forest carbon markets (ii) the interested parties and their role in the forest carbon markets, (iii) the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) approaches and role of remote sensing, (iv) the challenges, and (v) the benefits, opportunities, future directions and recommendations to enhance forest carbon markets in LATAM. Despite the substantial challenges, better governance structures for forest carbon markets can increase the number, quality and integrity of projects and support the carbon sequestration capacity of the rainforests of LATAM. Due to the complex and extensive nature of forest carbon projects in LATAM, emerging technologies like remote sensing can enable scale and reduce technical barriers to MRV, if properly benchmarked. The future directions and recommendations provided are intended to improve upon the existing infrastructure and governance mechanisms, and encourage further participation from the public and private sectors in forest carbon markets in LATAM.}

Yet, the existing scant literature has never addressed this phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to provide insights about determinants of port decarbonisation implementation. The implementation theory (ImpThry) lens and port decarbonisation literature were reviewed and then both bodies of literature were cross analysed to demonstrate the applicability of ImpThry to port decarbonisation and identify determinants of successful implementation. Results have presented six constructs, i.e., implementation schemes, level of governance, interorganisational relationships, disposition and commitment of managers, capacities and economic conditions, and engagement with target groups, as determinants of port decarbonisations. Additionally, measurement items were identified, and several hypotheses were proposed. While the results presented a new conceptualisation based on ImpThry and paved the way of empirical investigation in future research, it also has managerial implications. The various demonstrated determinants inspire and direct the attention of port business managers and decision-makers to implementation pathways to achieve the decarbonation goal. Also, determinants draw attention to why port decarbonisation implementation succeeds or fails. While this is the first study that addresses this topic, it is considered as an extended application of the ImpThry in port decarbonisation. Nonetheless, the findings from this research make a desirable contribution to smooth port decarbonisation implementation.}

The review draws on a systematic selection and analysis of 131 primary sources, including peer-reviewed articles, books, and chapters published between 2016 and 2023. The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes, and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies, inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry; and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls for a holistic application of this ‘new’ paradigm and refrain from cherry-picking ‘cheap and easy’ technologies and applications; and suggests that the construction industry may be able to leapfrog the ‘4.0’ revolution and directly embrace a ‘5.0’ approach by incorporating a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

abstract = {Context:
The demand for protection and security of physical spaces and urban areas increased with the escalation of terroristic attacks in recent years. We envision with the proposed cyber–physical systems and spaces, a city that would indeed become a smarter urbanistic object, proactively providing alerts and being protective against any threat.
Objectives:
This survey intend to provide a systematic multivocal literature survey comprised of an updated, comprehensive and timely overview of state of the art in counter-terrorism cyber–physical systems, hence aimed at the protection of cyber–physical spaces. Hence, provide guidelines to law enforcement agencies and practitioners providing a description of technologies and best practices for the protection of public spaces.
Methods:
We analyzed 112 papers collected from different online sources, both from the academic field and from websites and blogs ranging from 2004 till mid-2022.
Results:
(a) There is no one single bullet-proof solution available for the protection of public spaces. (b) From our analysis we found three major active fields for the protection of public spaces: Information Technologies, Architectural approaches, Organizational field. (c) While the academic suggest best practices and methodologies for the protection of urban areas, the market did not provide any type of implementation of such suggested approaches, which shows a lack of fertilization between academia and industry.
Conclusion:
The overall analysis has led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely, multiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and security in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to rethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in continuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.}

In recent years, agricultural industrialization has caused the loss of some important ecosystem services in agroecosystems, hindering some sustainable development goals (SDGs). In order to promote sustainable agricultural development, it is necessary to restore the damaged agroecosystems and improve agroecosystem services (AES). However, there are relatively few studies on AES, and fewer studies concerning the definition or connotation of AES. Therefore, this paper reviews current AES research, indicators, and assessment methods, as well as directions for future research. AES are determined by agroecosystem functions and human agricultural practices, with both positive and negative effects, scale effects, and trade-offs and synergies between AES. AES indicators can be classified as provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services, with a few studies including supporting services. Currently, the main AES assessment methods include public participation, empirical model, mechanism model, and value estimation. Multi-source data fusion for integrated models to assess multiple AES will be the future research trend. In addition, AES research should develop additional promising topics, including considering both AES and agroecosystem disservices (AEDS); assessing AES supply, demand, and flow; and analyzing AES trade-offs and synergies comprehensively. This will extend the research field to the links between AES and SDGs and their applications in agricultural landscape planning and governance. This review highlights the importance of AES research to more effectively manage agroecosystems and promote sustainable agricultural development.}

These persistent anomalous warming events can have severe ecological and socioeconomic impacts, threatening ecologically and economically vital organisms such as bivalves and the ecosystems they support. Developing robust environmental and social frameworks to enhance the resilience and adaptability of bivalve aquaculture is critical to ensuring the sustainability of this crucial food source. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the physiological and ecological impacts of MHWs on commercially important bivalve species farmed globally. We propose an integrated risk assessment framework that encompasses environmental monitoring, farm-level preparedness planning, and community-level social support systems to safeguard bivalve aquaculture. Specifically, we examine heatwave prediction models, local mitigation strategies, and social programs that could mitigate the impacts on bivalve farms and vulnerable coastal communities economically dependent on this fishery. At the farm level, adaptation strategies such as selective breeding for heat-tolerant strains, optimized site selection, and adjustments to culture practices can improve survival outcomes during MHWs. Robust disease surveillance and management programs are essential for early detection and rapid response. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement, knowledge exchange, and collaborative governance in developing context-specific, inclusive, and equitable safeguard systems. Proactive measures, such as advanced forecasting tools like the California Current Marine Heat Wave Tracker developed by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, enable preemptive action before losses occur. Coordinated preparation and response, underpinned by continuous monitoring and adaptive management, promise to protect these climate-vulnerable food systems and coastal communities. However, sustained research, innovation, and cross-sector collaboration are imperative to navigate the challenges posed by our rapidly changing oceans.}

This research synthesizes the top-ten limitations that indicate inadequacy of the existing water resources management practices to enhance ecosystem sustainability potential. In parallel, the research advocates and demonstrates the pressing need of ecohydrology as a scientific paradigm. The identified limitations comprise: (1) underutilized role of dual regulation between ‘biota and hydrology’; (2) the significant size of scarce productive lands that are forced to be out of production due to sizes of the physical land management technologies; (3) tendencies to over-engineer the environment; (4) less focus on water and nutrient cycle regulation; (5) tendency of considering the biological measures as a mere stabilizers of the physical measures instead of its opportunity for dual regulation (which is one of the ecohydrologic principles); (6) failure to target multiple ecosystem services as outcomes; (7) failure to provide immediate benefits to the farmers; (8) recommending passive restoration of extremely degraded landscapes which actually need ecologically assisted; (9) the need of climate-smartness of landscape restoration practices; and (10) tendency to be sectoral instead of systemically operating. The research also demonstrated that ecohydrologic strategy can address these gaps through its low-cost and high-impact practices.}

However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include ‘smart packaging’ that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.}

To our knowledge, this is the first paper that identifies 14 digital ethics implications for the use of AI in seven DT archetypes using a novel ontological framework (physical, cognitive, information, and governance). The paper presents key findings of the review and a conceptual model with twelve propositions highlighting the impact of digital ethics implications on societal impact, as moderated by DT archetypes and mediated by organisational impact. The implications of intelligibility, accountability, fairness, and autonomy (under the cognitive domain), and privacy (under the information domain) are the most widely discussed in our sample. Furthermore, ethical implications related to the governance domain are shown to be generally applicable for most DT archetypes. Implications under the physical domain are less prominent when it comes to AI diffusion with one exception (safety). The key findings and resulting conceptual model have academic and professional implications.}

An emerging disruptive solution with high potential for improved sustainability is using drones as a mode of transport, i.e., Advanced Air Mobility for passenger and freight transport in urban and rural areas,fuelled by electricity or green hydrogen. As drones are being rapidly commercialized, there is a need for a policy framework for local and regional actors to address this in decision-making. This paper aims to develop a policy framework through a systematic literature review where findings have been validated by experts from industry and appropriate governance bodies. The results reveal three conceptual elements in the Advanced Air Mobility system where policy actions are needed: 1) primary technology, including vehicle-related aspects; 2) functionality, including infrastructure and operations; and 3) adoption, including the environment, market, and society. The overall lack of a multi-level governance model for Advanced Air Mobility and the scarcity of knowledge of the topic within vital fields such as energy systems and regional planning are also addressed. The findings are discussed in light of regulatory frameworks for drone transportation in Europe. The paper concludes with a policy development framework for regional Advanced Air Mobility deployment and provides policy implications.}

abstract = {Summary
Conflict and climate change might be present in the same areas and expose communities that struggle with these dual risks, but they do not co-occur in consistent or predictable ways. We question how to effectively adapt to climate change in areas experiencing violence. Conflict can make adaptation to climate change more difficult, but when local conflict patterns are better understood it is possible to introduce climate adaptation measures that are effective and responsive to the needs of the population. Further, we argue that conflict mitigation is not a climate adaptation. Even in conflict zones, the most effective climate adaptations focus on climate-centred technical solutions and poverty reduction, local governance legitimacy, and community-led efforts to cooperate in periods of climate stress. We outline some of these possibilities.}

abstract = {Currently, the research agenda of energy transition is gaining momentum. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of this body of research by presenting a framework that describes the connotations, mechanisms, and effects of energy transitions. The study concludes that the energy transition will lead to the reconstruction of energy system elements beyond the energy sector, with the dual connotations of explicit transition and implicit transition. The explicit transition is usually captured by statistic data and information, for instance, energy utilization type, structure, form, transportation mode, and spatial pattern. The implicit transition involves shifts in energy security, geopolitical structure, energy power, energy justice, and energy governance, which receives relatively less attention in current literature. The energy transition is a highly socialized process, driven by many intertwined factors such as technological innovation, market mechanisms, policy arrangements, and sociocultural factors, triggering profound socio-economic and ecological effects. Looking ahead, it is urgent to pay attention to the multi-scale effects of energy transition, avoid the risks brought by energy transition, and ultimately achieve just energy transition. This paper provides a novel perspective and contributes to the literature on theoretical understanding and advancement of energy transition.}

This suggests that detrimental social practices need to be fundamentally changed. While social innovation is one possible approach for such change, a comprehensive picture of research on social innovation in relation to ecological challenges is missing. Therefore, with an emphasis on so-called strong sustainability, this article's purpose was to investigate social innovation's potential in relation to ecological crises, to identify important gaps, and advance research implications. A systematic literature review of social innovation research that address environmental issues was carried out, and the resulting literature was analyzed according to sustainability and five dimensions of social innovation. To reap more of social innovation's potential in our time of ecological crises, we suggest a move in social innovation research towards strong sustainability and propose such research avenues within each of the five dimensions of social innovation: conceptualization, environmental needs and challenges, key resources, capabilities, and constraints, types of governance, networks and actors, and, finally, process dynamics for strongly sustainable social innovation.}

Using a qualitative exploratory approach, the study data from eighty-nine secondary sources guided by six topical search themes. With over 85% of the secondary sources spanning from 2000 to 2022, the review suggests that politics and space are diverse and multidisciplinary concepts, while space and political philosophies, as well as human systems, cocreate PoS. The analysis indicates that PoS is context-responsive, yet no clear definition exists. Reflections on the PoS are qualitative, and there is a general lack of the application of mixed methods in its investigation. Remarkably, themes like inequality, control, discrimination, suppression, exclusion and words of similar meanings are characteristics of PoS research. Human-constructed systems like cultural, market, management and governance structures drive the themes. Hence, within the complexities of politics and space, humans and systems construct and reconstruct the PoS as social and political actors envision. The multi-varied nature of politics and space should lead to the application of mixed methods in future studies on PoS. Also, PoS could benefit from a cross-continent perspective using the different social contexts and systems to help gather holistic knowledge towards conceptualisation.}

However, the way BEs are – and need to be – driven by policy to reach cities’ circular goals is still an under-researched aspect. Particularly, there is limited knowledge of policy instruments aimed to foster the transition towards a circular built environment. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature search and a review of scientific publications to characterize the relation between the circular built environment and policy instruments suggesting its implementation from a circular city development perspective. We do so by answering: (1) how many publications elaborate on CBE policy instruments, (2) what type of circular actions in relation to circular city development are mentioned, and (3) what policy instruments are proposed to implement a CBE. The literature search is performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our results show that 53% of publications address policies instruments for circular built environment transitions. Although different circular actions are identified, looping actions prevail. Adapting and ecologically-regenerating actions, which are essential for circular city development, remain insufficiently researched. Finally, among policy instruments for circular built environment implementation there is a clear tendency towards regulation as means for leverage, which calls for bigger research efforts concerning the mix of policy instruments, as well as in more general challenges in governance and policy coherence.}

Leveraging digitalization, in the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design, construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends, challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible, energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real-time data collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30%–50% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040. While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the adoption of digital technologies.}

While there is now an extensive body of literature describing expected climate change impacts and potential responses, studies characterizing the implementation of adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management remain rare in the Canadian forest sector. Using a systematic literature review, we examined reports on forest management practices implemented in response to climate change, specifically focusing on governance and institutional arrangements that either support or limit climate change adaptation and mitigation responses. Our literature sample size of 24 documents suggests that the body of literature reporting on adaptation and mitigation practices in forest management is scarce. Governments remain the dominant actors providing funding and leading the implementation and reporting of climate change adaptation practices, primarily in response to national or international climate change commitments. Forest practices such as enhanced silviculture, assisted migration, and nature-based solutions were the most frequently reported. However, given the scarcity of literature, it is difficult to conclude the scope of climate change adaptation practice uptake in Canada. Barriers such as lack of information/data, inter-jurisdictional knowledge transfer, policy conflicts, forest tenure models, technical capacity gaps, and economic barriers to adaptation need to be overcome to strengthen climate change response in forest management. Better coordination of reporting at the provincial and national levels and improved information flows between private sector organizations and governments are needed.}

ICOs represent an alternative and innovative financing solution that has experienced spectacular growth and notoriety in recent years. ICOs rely on Blockchain protocols and the ICO market is, therefore, characterized as decentralized, disintermediated and unregulated. Our results show that although the ICO market is innovative, it already displays many of the problems of traditional financial markets, and that these problems were at the genesis of the last financial crisis. Our analysis of the problems and solutions adopted shows a tension between what the Blockchain technology offers, and the problems associated with the financing of innovation. Considering the problems and solutions adopted, we no longer expect the ICO market to be characterized as disintermediated, unregulated or even decentralized in the near future. Furthermore, it is a real possibility that ICOs may end up being a progressor model eventually replaced by similar but more specialized financing models, some of which may already exist. With respect to the particular solutions of the ICO market, while some represent the realization of the potential of Blockchain, others such as forks have important Governance implications with the potential to create as many problems as the ones they address.}

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users’ privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened.}

It has become a global pandemic, and COVID-19 poses so far unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems around the globe, particularly to those with weakened immune systems. Effective methods for managing, diagnosing, and lessening the effects of COVID-19 are critical because, by 2024, the virus has already caused over 7 million deaths. In this study, we anatomize the impacts of the latest COVID-19 virus on patients with the help of computational intelligence, like Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and IoT-enabled technologies for managing, analyzing, diagnosing, and predicting COVID-19. With tools for early identification, risk assessment, and therapy optimization, machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown tremendous promise in the healthcare industry. These tools can examine big datasets to find patterns and trends that might not be noticeable to human observers. Additionally, IoT will enable healthcare firms to monitor patient scenarios properly and reduce the readmission of COVID-19 patients. Wearable sensors and remote monitoring systems are two examples of IoT-enabled gadgets that are vital for tracking the COVID-19 virus's spread and keeping an eye on its sufferers. These gadgets can gather data in real-time on environmental variables, symptoms, and vital signs, giving medical professionals important insights into the state of their patients' health and the course of their diseases. This study will play a vital role in competing for safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and exposure with the assistance of smart technology and provide much-needed information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on patients that will benefit globally.}

This systematic analysis of urban sustainability literature involved the review of 241 studies published between 2010 and 2022. We critically examined current debates and challenges in urban sustainability, identifying gaps and opportunities and providing recommendations for creating equitable, just, and sustainable urban futures. We also reviewed 23 studies to summarize the social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) indicators used to measure urban sustainability in the same period, many of which may not be relevant to the lived experiences of marginalized communities. To move toward more meaningful and equitable pathways, it is important to develop SETS indicators of urban sustainability that are reflective of the experiences and priorities of diverse groups in society. This review identifies four major issues in the current urban sustainability literature: space, scale, stakeholders, and dimension.

abstract = {In rapidly growing southern metropolises, climatic, anthropogenic and demographic pressures combined with centralized network deficiencies, favor individual initiatives to access freshwater, e.g., illegal well settlements, pirate connection to the distribution network, rainwater harvesting, and storage in tanks. These strategies are amplified by extreme meteorological events (e.g., droughts) that also trigger cognitive mechanisms, such as denial, opportunism or a kind of “myopic” competition to access the resource without considering (knowing) collateral impacts. From these environmental and social dimensions, this review first evaluates the arguments for the integration of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in socio-environmental observatories (SEO). SEO are structures concurrently monitoring natural, anthropogenic, and engineered processes but also relationships between stakeholders/managers and end-users. Second, in order to take advantage from the current private (and illegal) strategies, MAR implementation accompanied with a SEO structure is discussed to show how it promotes cognitive, social, economic, and governance conditions required for successful co-management.}

abstract = {Scientific publishing systems (SPS) provides platforms to authors, reviewers, and editors to express research for the betterment of the community. Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.}

We explore the extent to which private automobility will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared electric automated mobility regime that could effectively address societal sustainability challenges. We draw from the multi-level perspective of technological transition, develop a conceptual model outlining possible transition advancements towards private and shared electric automated mobility and review pertinent literature supporting such developments. Our analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). We conclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. Hence, the socioeconomic benefits of the so-called “three revolutions of automobility” could be diminished.}

Promoting and implementing 5G smart healthcare can reduce inconsistencies in allocating medical resources and expedite medical advancements. This article studied the 5G and its need in healthcare. Smart Principal Features and Serviceable Pillars of 5G Technology for healthcare are discussed briefly. Finally, identify and discuss significant applications of 5G for healthcare. 5G promises to give people more control over their health. With the implementation of 5G, we will most certainly witness the introduction of new medical technology, allowing patients to test and monitor their health from the comfort of their homes. The combination of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will result in a network of smart devices that connect and, as a result, will broaden the backdrop for decision-making. It also creates new potential for the growth of the internal medical ecosystem. 5G network connection and coverage may be limited in areas with tall and broad trees and buildings. In the future, network operators and medical device makers will collaborate more in smart medical care.}

abstract = {Background
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing in food supply chains. The ethical language associated with food supply and technology is contextualised and framed by the meaning given to it by stakeholders. Failure to differentiate between these nuanced meanings can create a barrier to technology adoption and reduce the benefit derived.
Scope and approach
The aim of this review paper is to consider the embedded ethical language used by stakeholders who collaborate in the adoption of AI in food supply chains. Ethical perspectives frame this literature review and provide structure to consider how to shape a common discourse to build trust in, and frame more considered utilisation of, AI in food supply chains to the benefit of users, and wider society.
Key findings and conclusions
Whilst the nature of data within the food system is much broader than the personal data covered by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ethical issues for computational and AI systems are similar and can be considered in terms of particular aspects: transparency, traceability, explainability, interpretability, accessibility, accountability and responsibility. The outputs of this research assist in giving a more rounded understanding of the language used, exploring the ethical interaction of aspects of AI used in food supply chains and also the management activities and actions that can be adopted to improve the applicability of AI technology, increase engagement and derive greater performance benefits. This work has implications for those developing AI governance protocols for the food supply chain as well as supply chain practitioners.}

Managing such a complex system sustainably relies on knowing what aspects can be managed, and conversely what aspects are outside the control of the manager. Accordingly, by taking elements from existing environmental management approaches, especially in Europe and Canada, here we propose an integrated systems analysis approach which links 14 component sub-systems. Using these cases shows that while all elements exist, they have hitherto not been combined into a holistic decision support system. These components are linked here in a cycle of three Parts - (A) defining the policy problems facing the seas, (B) obtaining the relevant and fit-for-purpose natural and social sciences data and information, and (C) creating an input for policy and decision-making which involves stakeholders. The component sub-systems are: an Underpinning Framework Sub-system (1), which then leads to the Issue Sub-system (2), which is vision-related and includes causes and/or consequences of pressures to be managed. The Ecological Sub-system (3) links the biota and its environment to the Socio-ecological Sub-system (4) and the Socio-economic subsystem (5), which considers the macroeconomic aspects. The Resources and Delivery Sub-system (6) considers which scientists do what and how do they do it and the Provenance Sub-system (7) checks that there is a fit-for-purpose and defendable science evidence base. The Governance Sub-system (8), incorporates policies and politics as well as horizontally and vertically integrating the Legislative (8A) and the Administrative Sub-systems (8B). The Communication (8C) and Stakeholder Sub-systems (8D) ensure involvement across the stakeholder typology (of formal and informal actors). Finally, the Achievement Sub-system (9) and the Feedback Sub-system (10) ensures that all of these actions achieve successful and sustainable marine resource management.}

A common characteristic of these ecosystems is their complex composition, which often involves the interaction of multiple actors. Currently, the notions of "networking", "collaboration", "coordination", and "cooperation", although having different meanings, are often loosely used to describe these interactions, which creates a sense of ambiguity and confusion. To better characterize the nature of interactions in current and emerging ecosystems, this article uses the systematic literature review method to analyse 34 emerging cases. The objective is threefold (a) to study the interactions and engagements between the involved actors, aiming at identifying elements of collaboration. (b) Identify the adopted technological enablers, and (c) ascertain how the composition and functions of these ecosystems compare to virtual power plants. The outcome revealed that the interactions between the members of these ecosystems can be described as cooperation and not necessarily as collaboration, except in a few cases. Regarding technological enablers, a vast panoply of technologies, such as IoT devices, smart meters, intelligent software agents, peer-to-peer networks, distributed ledger systems/blockchain technology (including smart contracts, blockchain as a platform service, and cryptocurrencies) were found. In comparison with virtual power plants, these ecosystems have similar composition, thus, having multiple actors, comprised of decentralized and heterogeneous technologies, and are formed by aggregating various distributed energy resources. They are also supported by ICT and are characterized by the simultaneous flow of information and energy.}

In this investigation, we examined the potential nexus between Indian forestry system (biodiversity-enriched assets, ecosystem services, constitutional mechanisms, and governances) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through theoretical underpinnings from literature that selected from database like Google Scholar, Indian forest survey reports, and information retrieved from Indian government websites. The significance of this review is that it presents comprehensive information about Indian forestry, biodiversity-rich assets, and sustainable forest management practices. The results show that Indian forestry as a whole is an integral part of the food-energy-water cycle and contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The investigation confirms that besides partly contributing to the economy and life support systems to many dependent species, forests also act as boosters in the areas of food security and health. Targets related to the climate action, peace, and partnership goals are well in place through various forestry interventions and environmental commitments by the Government of India.}

This index is a holistic assessment since it aims to capture the interconnected and complex nature of water-related issues by considering multiple dimensional aspects which helps stakeholders and policymakers to understand the overall status of water security. This framework uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), involving pairwise comparison, normalisation and weighting. Then, a CWSI will be calculated using the Linear Aggregation method. The robustness of this consolidated index is validated using sensitivity analysis by modifying the weight in the linear aggregation formula. By following each step cautiously, a CWSI can be constructed and interpreted correctly, thus, becoming a powerful tool for conveying complex information to the different stakeholders and assessing the status of water security with river basins. The CWSI allows decision-makers to prioritise areas that are most at risk and facilitate sustainable planning and management of water resources.}

Thus, in this article, we review the existing research on SO Applied to PS (SOAPS), within the context of wider adaption of Industry 4.0 (known as the fourth industrial revolution). Firstly, relevant articles are examined and reviewed to position the research and develop research questions that enable the highlighting of research gaps. Then, a methodology was created based on: the studied PS problem features, proposed optimization frameworks, executed simulation tools, the SO architectures and the experimentation and validation strategies used. Finally, we investigate how Industry 4.0 could enhance the existing research on SOAPS to provide real-time and efficient SO-based DSTs for PS modules within modern manufacturing systems.}

Online data pools that catalogue information from NBS case studies may help scientists and practitioners to create this knowledge. The aim of this review is to assess the knowledge transfer potential of online data pools for implementing and upscaling NBS. For that, we compared 21 online data pools that report on NBS case studies in terms of topics, availability and quality of information on NBS. We found a high variability in quantity, type and quality of the information documented, hindering comparability and limiting knowledge transfer. Our results show that the most common knowledge provided was on actions undertaken on NBS, their outcomes, case study site descriptions, specific challenges and information on responsible entities and partners. Information on key attributes of NBS, such as on ecosystem processes and services as well as on governance and financing issues, was often omitted. The missing information however would be important for further comparative research to overcome implementation gaps for NBS. Based on the discussion of our findings we propose categories for a more efficient online data pool and give recommendations for further research on NBS.}

abstract = {Typified by the United Nations' net-zero emission initiatives, the need for corporate bodies, including financial institutions, to fulfill their social contracts has become ever critical. Many studies have analyzed the expanding literature on environmental, social and governance (ESG) from various perspectives, but only a handful of this work directly informs the decision-making of practitioners like institutional investors. We address the mismatch by conducting a review of the literature that can benefit both academia and industry. Before commencing the review, we consulted experts in the industry by contacting institutional investors from Australia and Japan with Asset Under Management of as much as US$500 billion, along with others in the finance industry. These practitioners voiced limited interest in understanding the motivations of ESG-conscious investors, an area that many academic studies have examined. The most common of the practitioners' requests relates to how portfolios that are financially viable can be constructed to incorporate investors' ESG-related preferences. We conduct a systematic literature that is based on this feedback and find that, even in an ESG-themed investment vehicle, the investor's individual ESG preferences may not align well with the fund's objective and degree of conviction. We discuss the resulting challenges and opportunities investors face when integrating ESG into their investment practices, thus providing a guide for investors who wish to re-think their ESG strategies and beliefs. Finally, the paper draws attention to alternative ESG data and the need for studies on dynamic materiality-mapping.}

The lack of visibility about data quality in building energy performance monitoring motivated a review of 162 articles published since 2017. This identified that data quality reporting was fragmented and limited, with a gap from best practice and a lack of standardisation around requirements specific to building performance, including data comparability and spatiotemporal granularity. Where data quality issues were diagnosed, this was in isolation and concerned individual data quality attributes rather than within a comprehensive data governance strategy. This powerfully evidences the need to build consensus across AEC about (1) the required levels of data quality from building energy performance data, (2) a consistent reporting vocabulary and (3) how data quality is achieved.}

We were not ready for COVID-19, and people, economies, and governments around the world have suffered as a result. We must learn from these experiences now and implement transformational changes so that we can prevent future crises, and if and when emergencies do emerge, we can respond in more timely, robust and equitable ways, and minimize immediate and longer-term impacts. In 2020–21 the Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development assessed the challenges posed by COVID-19 in the WHO European region and the lessons from the response. The Commissioners have addressed health in its entirety, analyzing the interactions between health and sustainable development and considering how other policy priorities can contribute to achieving both.

In this study, we review the historical, theoretical, and practical capacities as well as the procedural and substantive details of existent programs that recognize good forestry practices in the United States. Current systems of recognition like Tree City USA and Urban Forest Sustainability and Management Audit are limited because they do not have robust third-party verification procedures that define liabilities of non-conformance to urban forestry standards. Moreover, the process of standardizing principles, criteria, and indicators has not been as detailed in these existent urban recognition systems as in traditional forest certification systems like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). We provide guidelines towards establishing an urban forest certification system building on knowledge from existing networks and institutions. We hope that this study will guide urban forest managers, communities, private companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders that have recently shown significant interest in instituting a more holistic certification-based governance system of recognizing sustainable urban forestry. An important opportunity is available for urban systems that recognize and promote good forestry practices to learn from existent mechanisms of forest certification about potential and challenges faced on the ground in standardization, recognition, and verification governance.}

Subsequently, Blockchains evolved from decentralized cryptocurrency ledgers to platforms for developing decentralized applications. A decentralized application needs a variety of data from the real world that cannot be directly provided by smart contracts. Oracles provide a mechanism to input data to the smart contracts for decentralized applications in a trusted manner. Oracles are the entities that collect data from data sources, verify it and then transmit it to the Blockchain. The introduction of Oracles has brought back the issues of centralization, single point of failure and reliance on a trusted third party in the Blockchain ecosystem. Oracles have adopted different means to reduce centralization and achieve some trustless operating mechanisms involving decentralized algorithms based on voting or reputation. In this paper, we analyse the concept of the Blockchain Oracle problem, its effects on various Blockchain applications, various Oracle types and trust mechanisms. We also analyse some of the significant Oracles (like chainlink, provable), and their underlying mechanisms and compare them. In the end, we carry out a gap analysis and discuss some open research issues that must be addressed to achieve robust and secure decentralization.}

Non-biodegradable food packaging (mainly plastic) and food waste are two major concerns that cause severe environmental and economic challenges as well as potential human health and food insecurity risks. Therefore, intensive efforts are being devoted to transforming food production and consumption patterns and developing alternative technological solutions to alleviate such issues.
Scope and approach
This review intends to discuss the interplay between food packaging, food waste, and sustainability. Some common strategies used in food packaging are briefly summarised. The significance of nanobiotechnology, smart sensors, and other fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) innovations is emphasized, focusing of the role of these smart technologies in the emergence of novel prospects, such as the development of active and intelligent packaging systems. In addition, insights on consumer acceptance of novel packaging materials/technologies are given and conclusions are drawn. Key findings and conclusions: Several innovative food packaging solutions based on Industry 4.0 technologies are being developed, changing the way food is packed and consumed. Indeed, growing evidence shows that digital technologies (particularly artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, and 3D printing) will have a greater impact on food packaging in the sense of “Packaging 4.0”. However, more research is still needed to fully harness the benefit of advanced technologies, enabling them to overcome current barriers and achieve a healthier and more sustainable food future.}

This study aims to investigate the impact of Industry 4.0, open innovation and green innovation performance on green innovation behaviour. To this end, a theoretical model was established. A quantitative research approach was applied in which survey data were utilized to capture 247 responses from different manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The model was tested using SmartPLSver3.0 to measure the structural relationship between variables. The findings indicate that Industry 4.0 and green innovation performance positively impact green innovation behaviour, compared to open innovation which has no impact. The impact of green innovation performance is found to be stronger when compared to Industry 4.0 and open innovation. Likewise, green innovation performance exhibits a substantial mediating impact between the exogenous variables and green innovation behaviour. The policy implication and conclusions are further discussed in the last section of the study.}

To address the malnutrition and poverty affecting approximately 700 million people in Africa, there is potential for the One Health approach implementation and operationalization to bring together multidisciplinary solutions for tackling food insecurity and ensuring food safety net. However, there is limited documentation on the potential of the One Health approach system thinking implementation to guide responses to triple crises-induced food insecurity. Therefore, this article aims to systematically understand the triple crises-induced food insecurity, connect existing solutions, and explore the role of the One Health approach in strengthening food and agriculture systems in Africa. Our finding showed the impact of triple crises exacerbating food system vulnerability in Africa and worldwide. Mitigating and resilient actions are urgently needed in tackling the emerging and persisting challenges, and infectious diseases menace and burden across Africa. We present a conceptual model illustrating the complex nature of triple crises-induced food insecurity, vulnerability areas within the food system, and actionable strategies for building community food resilience. Additionally, recommendations are provided to create an enabling environment that supports One Health approach implementation and addresses food insecurity challenges through innovative partnerships, local-led initiatives, and enhanced governance and artificial intelligence technology capacities in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth to reduce socio-economic inequalities. Stepping up integrated, actionable, and sustainable food systems programs and innovative long-lasting solutions requires investing in promoting new partnership and research collaboration in building conflict resolution and peace towards strengthening and reshaping local and global food security related climate change adaptations actions for most vulnerable communities’ benefits. These are ingredients in fastening preparedness, prevention and control of infectious diseases prevention and control, reducing food supply chains disruption towards accelerating equitable benefits of Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals, 2030 across Africa.}

The quantitative analysis identified 14 prevalent topics, while the qualitative analysis provided nuanced insights into the contexts underlying these topics. Leveraging Donabedian's framework, the topics were categorized into structure (training and digital health professionals, governance frameworks, computing infrastructure, public-private partnerships, regulatory frameworks), process (AI and big data, decision-support systems, shared digital health records, disease surveillance, information system interoperability), and outcome dimensions (improved health and social care, privacy and security, quality and efficiency of health services, universal coverage, sustainable development goals). This hybrid methodology offers a unique contribution by mapping the identified themes onto a widely accepted quality of care model, bridging the gap between policy analysis and healthcare quality assessment. The study unveils underaddressed themes, highlights the interrelationships between policy components, and provides a comprehensive understanding of the global digital health policy landscape. The findings inform future strategies, academic research directions, and potential policy considerations for governments formulating digital health regulations.}

The impact of human activities on the ECZ is currently underexplored, posing challenges for sustainable future development. Here we delve into the effects of industrialization, urbanization, and technological progress on resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and the loss of biodiversity, which lead to profound shifts in the ECZ's dynamics. Despite the substantial human influence on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, opportunities for positive change through technological innovation, environmental policy formulation, and enhanced global governance are identified. Drawing on examples from developed and developing nations, we discuss the disparities in environmental management and the potential for achieving a harmonious balance between economic growth, social equity, and environmental preservation within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper advocates for integrated approaches to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation, calling for strengthened international cooperation and the adoption of green development strategies. We conclude that achieving sustainable coexistence between humans and the Earth necessitates collective efforts across all levels of society, leveraging technological advancements and policy interventions to foster a resilient and sustainable global ecosystem.}

As energy user participation is paramount for their success but has proven to be difficult to obtain, we explore the usefulness of the ‘social license’ concept, originally developed in the mining sector, to refer to the process of creating acceptance in DSM programs aimed at managing or controlling household energy resources such EVs, batteries, and heating and cooling devices. We argue that analyzing the attainment or lack of ‘social license’ may be useful to energy policy-makers and researchers for understanding public concerns with not only supply-side energy resources, but also DSM. We do so by (1) drawing attention to potential frictions between demands for flexibility on the one hand and social practices and habits on the other; (2) attending to the ways that users’ engagement in DSM programs is influenced by their sense of control and agency, and their trust in program providers; and (3) exploring the ways that users may understand their stake in the energy system and may participate in programs as collectives rather than simply as individuals. We argue that a ‘social license to automate’ could not only describe a set of tools to manage participation in DSM projects, but rather assess the ways users effectively feel part of new energy systems designed to serve them.}

abstract = {Increasingly, scholarly debates and policy developments on citizen participation in energy transitions have included calls for ‘energy democracy’ and active forms of ‘energy citizenship’. The concepts are tightly connected to the debate on energy transition, and the need for a decentralised energy system, based on renewable energy and increased local energy ownership. The two concepts exist in parallel and are sometimes used as synonyms and sometimes with clear distinctions made between them. This spurred an interest to systematically investigate them further. The aim of this paper is to identify similarities and differences between the two concepts and synthesise their contributions to debates on citizen participation in energy transitions. We review the literature thematically, finding that the concepts often refer to participation in domestic energy technologies, energy communities, energy transition movements, and energy policy. Energy citizenship tends to emphasise behaviour change and ways for individuals to participate in energy systems, thereby often focusing on individuals as agents of change. In contrast, energy democracy tends to focus on institutionalisation of new forms of participative governance and often placing collectives as central agents of change. The review also highlights some weaknesses of the literature: a bias towards decentralised energy systems, a lack of attention to representational democracy, and an underrepresentation of studies from outside Europe and North America.}

The potential of the Metaverse is growing, as Web 3·0 development and adoption continues to advance medicine and healthcare. We define the next generation of interoperable healthcare ecosystem in the Metaverse. We examine the existing literature regarding the Metaverse, explain the technology framework to deliver an immersive experience, along with a technical comparison of legacy and novel Metaverse platforms that are publicly released and in active use. The potential applications of different features of the Metaverse, including avatar-based meetings, immersive simulations, and social interactions are examined with different roles from patients to healthcare providers and healthcare organizations. Present challenges in the development of the Metaverse healthcare ecosystem are discussed, along with potential solutions including capabilities requiring technological innovation, use cases requiring regulatory supervision, and sound governance. This proposed concept and framework of the Metaverse could potentially redefine the traditional healthcare system and enhance digital transformation in healthcare. Similar to AI technology at the beginning of this decade, real-world development and implementation of these capabilities are relatively nascent. Further pragmatic research is needed for the development of an interoperable healthcare ecosystem in the Metaverse.}

Incorporating a novel measure of asset managers’ market timing ability, we analyze the role played by performance persistence in mutual fund investing decisions by focusing on top performers in a short-time window. Our empirical results showed that preferences strongly influence the returns-flow dynamics when accounting for the asset type, geographical investment focus, and management style tilt, shedding new light on the behavior of certain clustered groups of investors. Furthermore, we find a long-run information effect as a proxy of a positive association between past returns and flows leading by the smart money effect. Surprisingly, we also observe irrational investors’ behavior when chasing for negative performers, likely due to a herding effect or flow persistent hypothesis as a result of the mechanisms of market allocation efficiency, which is likely to be affected by a slowdown functioning in the short-term phase. Robustness analyses confirm overall results.}

This has resulted in ongoing transformation into smart grids (SG) and spreading of energy communities (EC), making use of new digital technologies and renewable sources. Within this paper we aimed to compare the conceptual designs of EC energy market topologies with some of their practical applications in Europe. Although previous studies have already examined selected SG topologies, our work provides an umbrella view of all potential designs of energy market configuration in which a community plays an active role. In addition, we follow a pragmatic approach, comparing theory with practice, and showing how the theoretical EC concept is currently embedded in reality. This paper answers two research questions: (1) Which of the theoretical EC network topologies are currently used in practice (2) How and which network topologies of EC have the greatest chance for the implementation in the future projects? To answer these questions, we conduct a literature review together with a comparison analysis of three case studies from the Netherlands and Denmark. This comparison allowed us to formulate some observations and further recommendations on formal structure, communication, and management, which, in our opinion, are significant for organizations planning to set up their first smart EC initiative, especially in countries where the EC concept has not gained popularity yet.}

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.}

This study systematically analyses current literature to scrutinise the encountered resistance in transitioning toward a low-carbon economy. It extensively investigates the factors driving resistance across micro, meso, and macro levels, specifically focusing on three technology categories: consumer technologies, renewable energy, and smart energy systems. By synthesising insights from diverse studies that explore the political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of resistance, the primary aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge on energy transition and to provide insights that support more socially sustainable and democratic pathways toward low-carbon societies. Moreover, this study presents policy recommendations to address existing and potential resistance and opposition in this transition. Highlighting the distinctive aspects of each resistance case stresses the significance of acknowledging local intricacies and nuances in comprehending and addressing this resistance.}

Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes’ measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency. No systematic or generic approach was demonstrated for detecting sensor nodes and sensor node networks failures in large-scale CPS applications. Moreover, further research is required to address the challenges of ensuring the quality of the spatial and temporal contextual attributes of sensor nodes’ observations.}

However, despite significant policy attention, NBS plans often fail to materialize due to public budget shortfalls. Alongside traditional public finance, the international debate increasingly urges the mobilization of private capital for NBS through alternative financing (AF) techniques. In this scoping review, we examine the literature on a) the AF models connected to NBS and b) the drivers and barriers associated with these AF models in terms of their financial technicity and their embeddedness in the political, economic, social, technological, legal/institutional, and environmental/spatial (“PESTLE”) context. Although many models are discussed, the results indicate that none can be considered full substitutes for traditional public finance. Barriers and drivers converge around seven overarching tensions: new revenue and risk distribution vs. uncertainty, budgetary and legal pressure vs. political willingness and risk aversion, market demand vs. market failures, private sector engagement vs. social acceptance and risks, legal and institutional conduciveness vs. inertia, and upscaling potential vs. environmental risks and land use. Future research should focus on a) how to further integrate NBS monitoring, quantification, valuation, and monetization into AF models, b) systemic and empirical approaches to improve the understanding of the applicability and transferability of AF models, and c) an exploration of the potential qualities and social risks of AF models in NBS governance arrangements.}

Global warming is an increasing motivation to integrate renewable energy resources in water systems for different purposes like water pumping, water supply, and water distribution systems. As a result, to have a smart, sustainable and low-cost water system, renewable resources, energy management, and monitoring should be simultaneously implemented. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the research conducted on solutions and effects of integrating different types of renewable resources on water systems. As essential tools for secure integration of renewable resource in the water industry, the pivotal role of energy management and intelligent technologies within the water system have been explored. This review confirms the potential of achieving smart and sustainable water systems by simultaneously considering the use of renewable resources, conducting energy management strategies, and smartening the water system; however, further research is essential to improve water system performance and increase the efficiency of the system.}

The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration offers immense potential to return hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded tropical landscapes to functioning ecosystems. Well-designed restoration can tackle multiple Sustainable Development Goals, driving synergistic benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem services, agricultural and timber production, and local livelihoods at large spatial scales. To deliver on this potential, restoration efforts must recognise and reduce trade-offs among objectives, and minimize competition with food production and conservation of native ecosystems. Restoration initiatives also need to confront core environmental challenges of climate change and inappropriate planting in savanna biomes, be robustly funded over the long term, and address issues of poor governance, inadequate land tenure, and socio-cultural disparities in benefits and costs. Tackling these issues using the landscape approach is vital to realising the potential for restoration to break the cycle of land degradation and poverty, and deliver on its core environmental and social promises.}

Based on bibliometric and qualitative content analysis, works were classified by the type of SI, related renewable energy source, and geographical context. Associated sociotechnical changes, obstacles, and enabling factors of SI are also indicated. Main findings show that SI has an important role in local transitions but limited power to challenge the regime and scale-up. For just energy transitions, it can facilitate energy access, co-production, energy democracy, and participatory processes besides bringing regional socio-economic development and building community capacity. SI can contribute to renewable energy deployment through co-ownership and community finance. Also, community-led actions are in a unique position to access local tacit knowledge, influence individual behavior, and use them to build more sustainable cities. Finally, research limitations and directions towards future research are presented.}

The paper attempts to identify the major climate risks faced by coastal India through a systematic literature review between 1991 and 2022. Cyclones, Sea Level Rise, Floods, and Rainfall extremes accounted for more than 60 percent of the climate risks/issues on the Indian coast, with more pronounced incidences in the eastern coastal states than the western coastal states. We further analysed how different acts and policies associated with coastal management have addressed climate risks through a qualitative assessment of climate action plans of the Indian coastal states following the concept matrix approach. The results revealed that though a national-level policy is absent specifically for addressing coastal climate risks and adaptation, the coastal states have specific components on coastal vulnerabilities and adaptation. Further review of different states' disaster management acts, and policies emphasized the need for micro-level planning for climate-inclusive disaster management and building capacities of the concerned officials. The review of the evolution of coastal zone management in India revealed that there has been a dilution in the conservation of coastal ecosystems and reduction of no development zone under the pretext of enhancing livelihoods. The overall analysis of the national and state action plans, disaster management policies, and coastal regulation zone notifications in India shows that there is a need to include emerging climate risks in integrated planning and promote synergy amongst different sectors and institutions related to coastal governance and blue economy.}

In the big data era, vast volumes of data are generated daily as the foundation of data-driven scientific discovery. Thanks to the recent open data movement, much of these data are being made available to the public, significantly advancing scientific research and accelerating socio-technical development. However, not all data are suitable for opening or sharing because of concerns over privacy, ownership, trust, and incentive. Therefore, data sharing remains a challenge for specific data types and holders, making a bottleneck for further unleashing the potential of these “closed data.” To address this challenge, in this perspective, we conceptualize the current practices and technologies in data collaboration in a data-sharing-free manner and propose a concept of the model-sharing strategy for using closed data without sharing them. Supported by emerging advances in artificial intelligence, this strategy will unleash the large potential in closed data. Moreover, we show the advantages of the model-sharing strategy and explain how it will lead to a new paradigm of big data governance and collaboration.}

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.}

The need to achieve Sustainable Development (SD) is growing as well, and cosmetic companies are looking for innovative and sustainable solutions aimed at reducing their negative environmental, economic and social impacts. The interest in this field also regards the scientific community which investigates and proposes Circular Economy (CE) as a paradigm which could support companies in the transition towards a sustainable future. In this context, this study aims to analyze, through a bibliometric and systematic literature review, the state of the art of CE in the cosmetic industry by exploring the academic studies from different perspectives, such as the object of CE proposed solutions, the research methods applied, and the 4Rs principles inspiring the CE practices. In addition, the link between circular practices and sustainability is also investigated. The analysis permits to classify the circular practices into four categories: input valorization, packaging solution, output valorization, and governance and management. The main results show that the highest attention of CE practices is focused on the input valorization for the formulation of cosmetic products. In this regard, a link between agri-food and chemical sectors and the cosmetic industry emerges due to the high number of studies focused on the valorization of agri-food waste and by-products. On the other hand, packaging and output valorization options are less investigated among the scientific community. Finally, the category of governance and management highlights the importance of circular strategies not only in the production phase, but also at the organizational level, for example by proposing specific circular business models. Finally, the results highlight the existence of a link between circularity and sustainability concept, specifically focusing on the environmental dimension.}

abstract = {The purpose of the study is to characterise energy security in West Africa in a holistic manner rather than a specific element of energy security. Additionally, this study samples studies from West Africa for concluding rather than studies that predominate the Global North. Guided by the literature from the Global North and West Africa, an integrative review of literature and a content analysis of 52 sampled studies based on a literature search strategy was undertaken. The study identifies that energy security in West Africa is characterised by one region-specific factor (i.e., investment), five cross-sectors factors (i.e., governance, sustainability, reliability, affordability and regional energy pools), three sector-specific factors for the electricity sub-sector (i.e., energy demand-side management) and oil and gas sub-sector (i.e., availability and security). The three sector-specific factors for the electricity and oil and gas are also non-regional factors. The study concludes that energy security in the Global North and West Africa is characterised by similar cross-sector factors i.e., Governance, sustainability, reliability, affordability, regional energy integration and similar sector-specific factors i.e., energy demand-side management, availability and security. The difference lies largely in the region-specific factors and thinly in the nature of the manifestations of similar factors in both regions which may be influenced by sub-regional needs, risks and ambitions. The study increases the Africa voice on the subject. It also identifies that factors such as sustainability, security, energy sector investment has been understudied and as such future studies should focus on these factors.}

This paper analyzes trends and highlights the potential benefits of blockchain deployment in IoT and healthcare. According to the literature, blockchain technology is mostly utilized for data management operations in healthcare and IoT, specifically to improve data security, which includes data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. In both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower patients with regard to their data, respectively.}

Telemonitoring (TM) has been identified as a valuable solution, particularly for chronically ill, long-term or socially isolated patients. Several initiatives have since emerged. Thus, Portuguese stakeholders recognise the need to reflect upon TM's current state and prospects. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the TM landscape in Portugal. We begin by analysing the underlying conditions for telehealth development. Then, we describe the governmental strategy and priorities towards TM – the National Strategic Plan for Telehealth development and NHS reimbursement opportunities for TM. To understand TM implementation, adoption, and dissemination in Portugal, we analyse 46 reported initiatives and adoption studies focusing on providers’ perspectives. Finally, a structured reflection on current challenges and the way forward is provided, according to the seven domains of the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. The adoption of TM by Portuguese institutions has been growing, leveraged by the telehealth governance model and public reimbursement mechanisms, proving particularly relevant during the pandemic. However, monitored patients are still few. Low digital literacy among patients and providers, lack of care integration and resource scarcity represent barriers hampering pilot TM initiatives’ scale-up.}

Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

Many scholars similarly argue the importance of engaging youth in energy transitions; yet, there is limited understanding of whether and how youth are framed as legitimate actors in energy transitions scholarship. This paper examines how recent energy transitions research conceptualizes youth, specifically whether youth are approached as influential energy citizens or merely as passive actors. Results show that the majority of research does not frame youth as energy citizens per se; rather, the dominant focus is on energy literacy and the importance of educating youth about energy options. This is followed by scholarship exploring youth perspectives on, or testing youth knowledge about, different energy technologies, youth energy conservation behaviour, and youth climate advocacy. Limited scholarship has focused on the role and influence of youth in energy governance. Research is needed at the national to international scale, focused on the rationale, value added and influence of youth in the multi-lateral energy space, and at local or community scale, enabling youth's roles in local energy planning and renewable energy projects.}

However, there are likely to be broader implications arising from the digitalisation of agricultural innovation systems. Agricultural knowledge and advice networks are important components of agricultural innovation systems that have the potential to be digitally disrupted. In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise. These findings have implications for the oversight of international agri-food sectors.}

By describing the characteristics of a ‘healthy sustainable city’ and by bringing together the ideas underlying frameworks for health and sustainability, we develop a conceptual understanding of how cities may progress towards achieving significant improvements in health and the environment. We investigate how urban change works, and build a theoretical understanding of how urban change may be directed to integrate health and sustainability. We conclude that urban transformation needs to be a multi-scalar process across city sectors to meet the scale, speed and form of change required. We propose that this can best be achieved in practice through a composition of mechanisms, including strengthening city governance, enabling technological and social innovations, applying sustainable urban planning and infrastructure development, and impelling social behaviour change; supported by systems-driven policy and practice-focused scientific evidence.}

In this paper, we address the deficiency in DeFi security studies. To our best knowledge, our paper is the first to make a systematic analysis of DeFi security. First, we summarize the DeFi-related vulnerabilities in each blockchain layer. Additionally, application-level vulnerabilities are also analyzed. Then we classify and analyze real-world DeFi attacks based on the principles that correlate to the vulnerabilities. In addition, we collect optimization strategies from the data, network, consensus, smart contract, and application layers. And then, we describe the weaknesses and technical approaches they address. On the basis of this comprehensive analysis, we summarize several challenges and possible future directions in DeFi to offer ideas for further research.}

Power generation from clean energy sources may help to meet societal needs such as increasing electricity demand while complying with contemporary global challenges (e.g. climate change). This paper aims at qualitatively describing the development of clean energy technologies in Mexico by using a multi-perspective analytical framework. By integrating a meta-theoretical framework for national energy transitions and core concepts from policy mixes for sustainability transitions literature, a series of stylised facts are developed to qualitatively describe the evolution of clean energy technologies in Mexico from 1879 to 2021. Interactive governance theory is used as an analytical framework to synthesise these storylines by highlighting the role and interactions among technologies, actors, and policy instruments in governance processes. The case study revealed that the ever-growing electricity demand in Mexico have called for exploring different available energy sources and technologies over time. Diminishing oil and gas domestic reserves, increasing concerns around environmental issues, and worldwide agreements on greenhouse gas emission reductions have been the main drivers for clean energy and energy efficiency development in Mexico. However, different barriers to a clean energy transition in Mexico have been identified and discussed in this study: (1) access to a vast oil and gas resources in the past reinforced the position of fossil-fuel incumbent regimes, displacing clean energy technological niches; (2) lack of investment in clean energy research, development, and innovation; (3) policy paradigms have shifted based on (dynamic) societal needs and socio-political interests in favour of fossil fuel power generation. To overcome these barriers and allow a transition towards a clean energy electricity system in Mexico, multiple policy instruments have been identified and discussed.}

The organizational, technological, and social dimensions are still pivotal in digital transformation, while two new dimensions (sustainability and smart cities) still need to be explored in the existing literature. The need to deepen knowledge in digital transformation and refine the dimensions found is of paramount importance, as it involves some complexity due to organizational dynamics and the development of new technologies.

In this article we present a comprehensive review on cities’ experience in climate mitigation policy and policy learning, focusing on research published in journal articles. We provide observations from the literature on municipal experience in policy practice and on how local governments manage learning in urban mitigation policy. The review provides valuable examples and reflections on individual policy initiatives, both in terms of policy framing and policy instruments, but finds sporadic evidence on systematically successful policy learning and capacity building processes in the scientific literature. The number of scientific articles on empirical assessments of local policy learning are few, and the research found, published in numerous journals, potentially addressing different research communities, provides limited knowledge on policy learning in terms of lessons learned, lessons drawing and capacity building. Moreover, the literature builds mostly on case studies within particular institutional contexts, which makes the transferability of findings problematic. While evidence on policy learning is still limited, there are indications that under the right conditions, cities can “learn to learn”.}

China implemented the first phase of its National Healthy Cities pilot program from 2016-20. Along with related urban health governmental initiatives, the program has helped put health on the agenda of local governments while raising public awareness. Healthy City actions taken at the municipal scale also prepared cities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after intermittent trials spanning the past two decades, the Healthy Cities initiative in China has reached a crucial juncture. It risks becoming inconsequential given its overlap with other health promotion efforts, changing public health priorities in response to the pandemic, and the partial adoption of the Healthy Cities approach advanced by the World Health Organization (WHO). We recommend aligning the Healthy Cities initiative in China with strategic national and global level agendas such as Healthy China 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing an integrative governance framework to facilitate a coherent intersectoral program to systemically improve population health. Achieving this alignment will require leveraging the full spectrum of best practices in Healthy Cities actions and expanding assessment efforts.

abstract = {Integrating resilience into governance policies has facilitated disaster prevention and recovery strategies, as urbanization and climate change have led to various environmental mishaps. This study aims to answer the following questions through a systematic review of the literature on resilient cities, disaster resilience, and the impact of resilience on urban structures, using the ISO 37123 technical standard and the sustainability tripod: (1) How has the landscape of research surrounding resilient cities evolved? (2) Which axis of the sustainability tripod receives the most focus in research on resilient cities? The findings suggest that research on resilient cities is focused on developing both practical and theoretical definitions for the term, with a particular emphasis on finding solutions to human influences such as urbanization and environmental disasters. It is noted that the definition of resilience remains ambiguous, and each group of researchers can interpret or find the meaning of resilience. More investment is needed to develop resilience, particularly in disaster prevention and recovery, highlighting the social and environmental axes of the sustainability tripod and encouraging the population's participation in public decisions.}

Blockchain technology is a novel computing model and ecosystem for trusted digital services. The technology promotes trust and decentralization, which has inspired new ways to develop smart digital business, engage communities, and automate societies. This makes it a typical multidisciplinary technology enabler for sustainable development with unique properties including trust, automation, decentralization, immutability, and resilience. This Primer aims to emphasize the potential role of blockchain technology in assisting a transition to a sustainable society through shedding light on the rationale behind blockchains, their core properties, and the available variants to get started. The article also conveys the main challenges impeding blockchain technology from attaining its full potential. Therefore, we encourage researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts from different sectors to continue exploring blockchains and investigate their potential for multidisciplinary applications while raising awareness about the considerate and wise use of this technology.}

abstract = {There are calls for social innovation to help with the effort to halt biodiversity loss. However, research on social innovation and biodiversity is dispersed and covers a multitude of disciplines. A systematic overview of research on social innovation and biodiversity is missing and this paper contributes by focusing on social innovation to tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss and unsustainability. The paper reviews research on social innovation in changing land use (agriculture, forestry, aquatic ecosystems and cities), in tackling exploitation of organisms (fishing, hunting, harvesting), and in addressing threats of climate change, pollution and invasive species. Across these drivers, we find a) a strong emphasis on social innovation as civic action for changing practices in addressing unsustainability, b) that social innovation research tends to focus on local experimentation although there are bodies of literature on policy-driven innovations and consumer/producer-driven innovations, and c) that there is very little research taking a critical perspective to explore negative or unintended consequences of social innovation. Drawing on the review, we propose three cross cutting issues that can be a focus for future research, practice and supportive policy: social innovation for nature-based solutions, social innovation for participatory governance, and social innovation for technology that tackles biodiversity loss.}
