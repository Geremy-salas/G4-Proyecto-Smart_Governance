abstract = {The European energy policies introduced the Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) objective (Directive, 2010/31/EU and 2018/844/UE) to stimulate the energy transition of the construction sector. EU programs, specifically “Horizon 2020”, promote the NZEB design and also its evolution, namely the Positive Energy Building (PEB) model. Based on the most recent developments, a critical review of the main actions of the European Union towards the development of the NZEB and PEB design models has been conducted. Some considerations on advanced materials and technologies (PCM, VIP, smart glass, integrated photovoltaic systems) have also been added. Finally, a case study is presented (single-family residential NZEB) to show how a careful and integrated design of the building envelope and systems not only allows to obtain an almost total coverage of the energy consumption by renewable sources, but also to generate an energy surplus that could be shared with urban grids (PEB potential).}

abstract = {Robotics is the multi-disciplinary domain that is booming in today’s world, and expanding its roots deep into various fields of research, manufacturing industries, healthcare, and even in our day-to-day lives. Nevertheless, as with any other evolving technology, robotics face numerous challenges. In this context, lately, blockchain technology has been identified as a promising technology to resolve many of these issues such as identification of malicious/rogue nodes, malfunctioning/faults in automated processes, non-compliance to the agreed norms and privacy rules, security attacks on robotic systems, and non-transparency in performance monitoring and audits. In particular, blockchain with its features like decentrality, immutability, provenance, low operational cost, tight access control, and trustworthy operations, can offer significant improvements to new applications and use cases driven by robotics. Thus, the paper begins with exploring the key requirements and technical challenges encountered by robots in general. Next, it provides detailed overview of blockchain technology in a tutorial style. Then, the role of blockchain for different uses cases of robotics are surveyed. Furthermore, various technical challenges that need to be mitigated to harness full potential of blockchain for robotics are highlighted. Finally, the future research directions are presented that can pave the way ahead for advancements and profitable integration of blockchain in the realm of robotics.}

Embracing a DT framework can enable the visualization of interdependencies within civil systems, facilitating the prediction of interventions to mitigate future climate change impacts. Therefore, the scope of this review was to determine how UM results are represented to end users, such as architects, and engineers and evaluate if these methods align with industry practices. Initially, we analyzed 70 UM studies to investigate the methods and visualization techniques employed. Trends revealed minimal integration of UM with Industry 4.0 technologies or DTs. The findings underscored a lack of dynamic and geographically oriented visualization in UM, with static representation methods like bar charts and Sankey diagrams prevailing, and mostly disconnected from the geographical location of the flows represented. Consequently, the research was further expanded to explicitly review the use of emerging technologies from Industry 4.0, including DTs, using targeted words. An extended review showed a gap in the integration of the UM framework with DT technologies, although an increased use in mapping was depicted. There was inconsistency in the adoption of specific technologies or visualization methods, highlighting ongoing research in this area. The increased use of geographic information system (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) marked a pivotal change for more elaborate mapping of UM outcomes. Limited application of dynamic visualizations in UM persists, with MFA diagrams, Sankey diagrams, and bar charts being commonly used methods, despite the need to develop such type of visualizations in the sustainability field. There is an obvious lack of interoperability of these methods with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software as well as Building Information Model (BIM) software, which are standard tools in urban planning and design. This limitation is particularly significant in environments where the ability to modify planning scenarios and work with precise spatial representations is crucial. We argue that UM can be more effective if integrated with technologies such as DT, which can resolve the spatial issue and describe UM contextualizing it and potentially depicting it in real-time. Additionally, DTs can offer promising solution by integrating UM analysis results and facilitating modifications to the 3-dimensional environment based on this information. This capability empowers planners and designers to conduct simulations, update UM analyses, and iterate the design process, aligning with contemporary practices in planning and design. Given the interdisciplinary nature of UM, which includes various concepts such as urban flows, city flows, system of systems, and urban networks, our study deliberately focuses solely on UM and its associated frameworks. This targeted approach may limit the breadth of concepts explored, but it ensures depth and coherence in our analysis of UM for this study.}

Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.}

In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts. Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.}

These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology. Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real. The exploration revealed that due to the exponential uses of blockchain, investments involved, and a number of start-up businesses contributing to Industry 4.0, blockchain indeed has a credible potential in the construction industry.}

It can successfully design a virtual object from its physical counterpart. However, the main function of a digital twin system is to provide a bidirectional data flow between the physical and the virtual entity so that it can continuously upgrade the physical counterpart. It is a state-of-the-art iterative method for creating an autonomous system. Data is the brain or building block of any digital twin system. The articles that are found online cover an individual field or two at a time regarding data analysis technology. There are no overall studies found regarding this manner online. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the data level in the digital twin system, and it involves the data at various phases. This paper will provide a comparative study among all the fields in which digital twins have been applied in recent years. Digital twin works with a vast amount of data, which needs to be organized, stored, linked, and put together, which is also a motive of our study. Data is essential for building virtual models, making cyber-physical connections, and running intelligent operations. The current development status and the challenges present in the different phases of digital twin data analysis have been discussed. This paper also outlines how DT is used in different fields, like manufacturing, urban planning, agriculture, medicine, robotics, and the military/aviation industry, and shows a data structure based on every sector using recent review papers. Finally, we attempted to give a horizontal comparison based on the features of the data across various fields, to extract the commonalities and uniqueness of the data in different sectors, and to shed light on the challenges at the current level as well as the limitations and future of DT from a data standpoint.}

These fiscal supports are crucial, though there is concern that sustainable and resilient development will be sacrificed in the rush to preserve incomes and industries. The aim of the paper is to review whether the Japanese governments' responses in terms of financial stimulus considers longer term resilience and sustainability. This paper reviews pertinent academic literature and publicly available data from governments and organisations. The research is a rapid analysis of emerging information provided by the government of Japan and other international organisations. Using the case of Japan, this paper suggests that it is possible both to protect public health and essential services, while also promoting resilience and sustainability. Japan's integrated solutions show that pandemic response can include accelerated decarbonization and resilient, sustainable development. The paper also warns also that failure to act on long-term sustainability risks increased inequality, higher opportunity costs, cascading hazards, and further retreat from planetary thinking and globalism.}

The benefits of comfort and reliability of IoT technologies to human beings have brought with them security concerns. This is due to its large-scale connectivity and over reliance on the internet for communication making it susceptible to cyberattacks. Digital forensics experts face a daunting task of handling these cyberattacks because of the unique and complex challenges posed by IoT. Recently, researchers have been drawn to finding solutions to these challenges, however, this is still in its infancy. This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges. Finally, for future research directions from the SLR, we have highlighted and discussed the open challenges and requirements for IoT forensics.}

The authors, in this paper, have attempted to address this complexity and advance the understanding of the concept of liveability to planners, and its applicability to more inclusive policymaking. By availing of the body of knowledge in extant literature, the paper fosters a systematic understanding of the concepts of liveability and its key constructs, suggests various methods to measure liveability, and highlights the need for trade-offs between liveability and sustainability outcomes in urban planning. It also contributes to the identification of the inherent social construction reflecting the values, perceptions and experiences of its inhabitants in defining and measuring liveability. The authors suggest the use of cognitive, participatory and micro-scale indicators to assess liveability, while arguing in favour of a ‘pro-equity’ perspective in the local context; and opine that the assessment framework suggested can unearth opportunities to formulate place-based innovative policies to create liveable, sustainable and equitable cities. Bolstered by their findings from the review, the authors have introduced a novel participatory assessment approach, abbreviated as SaRVO, which they recommend to town planners and policymakers as well as researchers in the future.}

abstract = {Global plastics production is expected to exceed 400 million tons and reach 600 million tons by 2060. Their synthesis currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 60% of all polymers are produced for single-use. Examples include shopping bags, packaging materials, mulch films, and soluble polymers for cosmetics and other purposes. Currently, only a portion of single-use plastic is recycled or disposed of in incinerators or landfills. An estimated 20% is not disposed of properly and pollutes the global environment, especially the oceans. In response to these challenges, the United Nations, European Union, and many nation-states are developing regulatory frameworks that encourage the chemical industry to produce plastics with a smaller environmental footprint and often support this through research funding. Possible solutions include: (1) the use of green energy, green hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks, or CO2 in synthesis; (2) the reuse or recycling of plastics through conversion or pyrolysis; and (3) the production of biodegradable polymers. The German chemical industry contributes approximately one-third of polymer production in the EU. It is embedded in the EU regulatory and research landscape and anchored in the European Green Deal, which aims for carbon neutrality by 2050. In this paper, we describe how BASF and Evonik, two leading German chemical companies with strong but different polymer portfolios, respond to the call for greener polymers and how technologies are being developed to make polyurethanes, a particularly important and difficult-to-recycle family of elastomers and duromers, renewable and circular. Reducing the environmental footprint of plastics requires not only innovative materials but also proper governance, regulatory and collection systems, and public willingness to cooperate. In an international comparison of these competencies, expressed by the "polymer management index" (PMI), Germany achieved a top position.}

Given the differences in the degree of social development, resource endowment and technological level, each country should build a carbon-neutral plan based on its national conditions. Compared with other major developed countries (e.g., Germany, the United States and Japan), China's carbon neutrality has much bigger challenges, including a heavy and time-pressured carbon reduction task and the current energy structure that is over-dependent on fossil fuels. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of the key technologies for low-carbon, near-zero carbon, and negative carbon emissions. Technological innovations associated with coal, oil-gas and hydrogen industries and their future potential in reducing carbon emissions are particularly explained and assessed. Based on integrated analysis of international experience from the world's major developed countries, in-depth knowledge of the current and future technologies, and China's energy and ecological resources potential, five lessons for the implementation of China's carbon neutrality are proposed: (1) transformation of energy production pattern from a coal-dominated pattern to a diversified renewable energy pattern; (2) renewable power-to-X and large-scale underground energy storage; (3) integration of green hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization; (4) construction of clean energy systems based on smart sector coupling (ENSYSCO); (5) improvement of ecosystem carbon sinks both in nationwide forest land and potential desert in Northwest China. This paper provides an international perspective for a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of carbon neutrality in China, and can serve as a theoretical foundation for medium-long term carbon neutral policy formulation.}

The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.}

abstract = {The article maps the interface between technology and recycling, considering the advances and task management. The theme is important because of the environmental problems caused by waste, irregular disposal, and the low recycling rates in the world, around 45%. The first round of academic production analysis through the Scopus database shows that the word challenge is strongly associated with technology and recycling. The hypothesis from this first cluster organization is that recycling is an unresolved challenge regarding cost, management, and technology. To analyze the recycling system, we use the affirmatives of circular economy in line with sustainable principles. Using data mining, we searched to collect, organize, and analyze the literature on recycling and technology. Beginning with 84.542 records and making six coupling analyses, we found that challenge, process, material, environment, and management are more closely associated with recycling and technology. There is a dominance of laboratory experiments. Researchers have offered small contributions to action alternatives to recycling. In short, we looked for the intertwining between recycling and technology in academic production and did not find this connection. The article highlights the superficial stage of knowledge, analysis, management, and recycling technology use.}

While existing research aims at addressing the challenges of engineering BC-Apps by providing testing techniques and tools, blockchain-based software development is still an emerging research discipline, and therefore, best practices and tools for the V&V of BC-Apps are not yet sufficiently developed. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on V&V solutions for BC-Apps. Specifically, using a layered approach, we synthesize V&V tools and techniques addressing different components at various layers of the BC-App stack, as well as across the whole stack. Next, we provide a discussion on the challenges associated with BC-App V&V, and summarize a set of future research directions based on the challenges and gaps identified in existing research work.

Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions—including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management—with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just.}

The Government acknowledged the impossibility of universal grid electrification in the desire time frame (2025–2030). This study reviews the struggling rural off-grid initiative in South Africa to unpack effective, sustainable rural electrification approaches. It is based on a thorough evaluation of fellow African successful off-grid initiatives and the country’s energy transition that gave rise to its exiting energy landscape. It was revealed that the conventional electrification rate of 5 to 10% annual is not sufficient for the country to accomplish universal grid access by 2030. It requires a minimum of 20% electrification rate per annum at an enormous budget increase of over 200%, amounting to an excess of USD 500 million to achieve universal grid access by 2025. The following recommendations were proposed to address the existing unsustainable rural electrification practice in the country. A new energy policy that mandates the supply of 50 kWh/month electricity through renewable energy source is required. The policy should clearly stipulate incentives for local and provincial municipalities partaking in renewable energy initiatives after independently verified demand reduction. Furthermore, the new policy should also allow for innovative entrepreneurs and programmes to collaborate with said municipalities to achieve its mandate. Provision of learnerships in the Higher Education sector to support the envisaged increased need for technical expertise on renewable energy systems, optimisation, and smart metring should be enforced in the new policy. Lastly, a concerted approach to educating existing and potential consumers on the benefits of being unaffected by load shedding and control of their own demand management should be embarked on in a national drive.}

This paper reviews pledges made by African Heads of State at the 2021 UNFSS and examines how responsive those commitments are to three dimensions of sustainable healthy diets, namely, nutrition and health, socio-economic, and environmental. Second, the paper assesses how responsive the commitments are to the World Health Organization’s “priority food systems policy actions” that include nutrition labeling, marketing regulation, public food procurement, fiscal policies, food fortification, reformulation, and food safety. We operationally define responsiveness as alignment or relatedness of the commitments to the dimensions of sustainable healthy diets, or the priority policies.

This assistive technology innovates information and communication development paradigms, such as directly connecting the brain and multimedia devices to the cyber world. The system converts brain information to understandable signals for multimedia devices without physical interference and replaces human-based languages with the external environment control protocols. This advancement challenges and limits security severely. For this reason, the rate of attacks, malware, ransomware, and other types of vulnerabilities is increasing drastically. Another reason is the need to improve traditional procedures to investigate cyberenvironment security aspects. Also, these malicious attackers' prime objective is to harm personal information, enable content security and privacy protocols and physical systems integrity, and create high risk between system and consumers. However, security's capital importance stems from the growing number of wearables (on-body) and in-body wireless devices. These limitations affect personal and healthcare wireless networks during the communication (such as on-chain and off-chain) between human and wearable sensors (sense and transmit) and actuators. This paper presents a novel, secure Blockchain Security Module (BSM) for BCI with Multimedia Life Cycle Framework (MLCF) (BSM-BCIMLCF) that safely connects wearables while investigating the present-day BCI life cycle (BCILC) protection. It homogenizes a Blockchain-based distributed permission network approach to overcome existing challenges. The Blockchain enables assistant cybersecurity for BCI distributed applications to identify brain operations in real-time.}

The Internet of Things has spawned a new fleet of medical devices replete with improved sensing and actuating capabilities. Preemptive mitigation of the cyber risks that arise in this hyperconnected space is needed to ensure continued patient safety.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to analyse the robustness of existing policy measures in securing the Internet of Medical Things technologies. The regulatory ecosystem in the US is primarily discussed herein and includes regulatory frameworks for industry, public-private partnerships, and transparency initiatives.
Methods
A qualitative review of the medical cybersecurity literature was performed with collation of federal and international legal documents, policy reports, industry frameworks, cyberbreach analyses, and scientific journal articles.
Results
Regulatory guidance documents introduced to date that address cybersecurity in the Internet of Medical Things place a key emphasis on device identification, legacy device management, enhanced physical security, and breach detection. Recent oversight trends aim to bolster federal authority around the enforcement of baseline security safeguards.
Conclusions
Additional regulatory guidance is needed to mitigate risks in the Internet of Medical Things devices conferred by retrofitted IT infrastructures, edge-to-cloud interfaces, and off-the-shelf device components. Recent advancements in the cyber realm also raise the possibility of novel attack vectors, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and quantum computing threats. Interventions to promote awareness and security hygiene around the Internet of Medical Things devices can empower end users and facilitate smooth incident response.
Lay summary
The rise “Smart” technologies such as voice assistants and adaptable at-home appliances moves us closer to a more personalized world that can enhance our daily lives. The field of medicine will be changed by these next generation “Internet of Things” technologies that possess the ability to interact with their users and their surrounding environment. These technologies are important because the precision with which medical devices interact with patients, healthcare workers, and other technology can have huge impact on patient care. For all of their promise, the increased interconnectivity that these devices possess also confers additional cybersecurity risks. Policy regulation and public health preparedness are critical for ensuring the benefits of these emerging technologies do not come at the expense of patient safety and privacy. In this Review, we discuss cybersecurity regulation in the Internet of Medical Things and highlight novel threats still in need of address at the policy and public-health levels.}

According to their modelling styles and applications, urban models can be classified into three categories: aggregate static models of economic and spatial interaction, urban dynamics models, and behavioural models of individual agents which linked to spatial location. According to the different modelling methods, urban models can be classified into two categories: top-down and bottom-up. Nowadays, emerging technologies, especially Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), are gradually but significantly changing the organization form of urban economic activities. It enables regions to break the location limitation and join in the national even global industry division, and that triggers a new bottom-up rural urbanization process, which formed a significant challenge for urban models. Based on above discussion, we proposed two perspectives for improvements of urban models, inculding the integration of ICT with tradtional urban models and integaration of top-down and bottom-up models.}

abstract = {Digital biosensors facilitate real-time, remote, precise disease detection and biochemical analysis. Recent trends in biosensing methods have focused on miniaturization, automation, and multiplexing. The miniaturization of biosensors has led to the development of portable, flexible, and wearable devices that can be used for point-of-care diagnostics and continuous health monitoring. Furthermore, digital automation has enabled the high-throughput screening of samples, reducing the time and cost of analysis, while integrated multiplexing allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of analysis. This article examines recent scientific advances in developing miniaturized biosensing procedures for digital healthcare. Advancements in digital devices have also contributed to the development of integrated biosensing. The use of smartphones, smartwatches, and other digital devices as readout platforms for biosensors has made biosensing more accessible and user-friendly. The development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has allowed for the interpretation and analysis of complex biosensor data. This review compares biosensing with current state-of-the-art diagnostic technology. After incorporating biosensors with artificial intelligence in an internet of things platform, they will have enormous potential and market value in the future for personalized healthcare. Based on various device performances and impacts, sensing methods, designs, compatibilities, functionalities, technology integrations, and developments are systematically discussed in this article. The primary objective of this review was to present a comprehensive discussion from the point of view of both technological advancements and translational wisdom. It is essential to have intelligent point-of-care devices with digital technologies for real-time healthcare management. The vision of the future healthcare industry encompasses a range of biosensing methods that offer a glimpse into new possibilities for the market.}

While research on energy transitions has generated an extensive literature, the extent to which it has used the policy innovation perspective – entailing policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success – remains unclear. This study analyzes over 8000 publications on energy transitions through a bibliometric review and computational text analysis to create an overview of the scholarship, map conceptual engagement with public policy, and identify the use of the policy innovation lens in the literature. We find that: (i) though the importance of public policy is frequently highlighted in the research, the public policy itself is analyzed only occasionally; (ii) studies focusing on public policy have primarily engaged with the concepts of policy mixes, policy change, and policy process; and (iii) the notions of policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success are hardly employed to understand the sources, speed, spread, or successes of energy transitions. We conclude that the value of the policy innovation lens for energy transitions research remains untapped and propose avenues for scholars to harness this potential.}

In this contribution, we provide an overview of key themes frequently discussed in the context of these so-called Intelligent Virtual Environments (IVEs). We highlight different ethical questions and the ways in which they are typically taken up in the literature. We first map how common concerns tend to revolve around technological feasibility and psychological impacts. We then ask how shifting the focus towards more philosophical perspectives might reorient discussions surrounding IVEs, opening up important avenues for future research. Our contribution in this review is to highlight how as active mediators of experience these technologies require critical reflection and should not be evaluated solely in terms of their functionality.}

In this review paper, an infrastructure-oriented approach is taken to systematically examine different types of interdependencies and resilience quantification techniques for water, transportation, and cyber infrastructures. Design, operations, and managerial strategies are identified and categorized into short-term, mid-term, and long-term plans that can potentially improve the resilience and sustanability of the underlying infrastructures.

As a result, we confirmed various value chain changes and directions for the development of the electricity industry. Energy consumers are turning into prosumers and influential stakeholders. In addition, the importance of data has been highlighted and the influence of platforms has been expanded. With the changes come along, various market participants appear, and at the same time businesses that do not adapt to the changes are at risk in terms of their market power. It can be seen that the changes demand efforts to encourage consumer participation into the energy market, rational mechanism of energy data sharing, and setting up of an efficient regulatory system. This study contributes to the understanding of the new changes and the demands resulting from ICT convergence in the electricity sector.}

Worldwide, low-carbon material solutions are the least investigated, whereas behavioral issues and circular economy are rarely examined in developed regions. Economic, informational, and attitudinal aspects are tackled more often than socio-technical issues. Adoption is more frequently described in terms of enabling reasons than barriers. Despite proven positive environmental attitudes and willingness to adopt low-carbon solutions, these are outweighed by financial aspects all over the world. A detailed account of the findings concerning reasons and barriers for adoption is presented for different solution categories.}

Fourth Generation Management arises as a systems-based approach for managing contemporary businesses before the advent of Industry 4.0 and during low awareness of the Circular Economy. While 4th Generation Management provides value to business by considering several resources, stakeholders, and interactions, making businesses customer-oriented, it fails to address the sustainability issue for contemporary businesses in the current context of Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and Stakeholders. Indeed, it fails to make businesses more contemporary (i.e., more open and sustainable) to adapt to their context. Moreover, in the literature, there is no work discussing how Sustainability, Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and diverse Stakeholders as contemporary issues are accounted for in business management. The main aim of this study is to propose a Re-engineered 4th Generation Management as a systems-based approach, enabling today's business to be oriented toward customer and sustainability. We have reviewed 181 articles published between 2005 and 2022 from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases to pursue such a goal. The novelty of this work relies on presenting a systems-based approach, which is best suited for sustainable businesses in the context of Industry 4.0 digitalization technologies (e.g., Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, and Big data analytics), Circular Economy, Stakeholders, and Competitiveness. Furthermore, propositions are formulated to reflect on the suggested framework based on recent literature. At the end of this work, research implications and future directions are provided.}

This study aimed to examine how different conditions and factors are linked to the development of NbS for urban climate change adaptation, with a specific focus on stormwater and flooding management. Through a systematic literature review, this study proposes a taxonomy of NbS to better understand the processes and hierarchies involved in developing NbS. The analysis covered multiple factors related to geographical focus and scale, sector, climatic conditions, adaptation and mitigation measures, ecosystem services, and co-benefits. These factors were linked to ten classified NbS approaches and 29 specific NbS interventions. An analysis of 582 empirical studies showed that Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) are the most dominant approaches of NbS for adaptation, followed by Low-Impact Development (LID), Green Infrastructure (GI), Sponge City (SC), and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). Among the different interventions, green roofs play a significant role in providing multifunctional ecosystem services and adaptation benefits such as stormwater and climate regulation. Policymakers and developers aiming to expand the implementation of NbS can consider the taxonomy proposed in this study to choose the right types of NbS and obtain maximum co-benefits.}

“Advanced Materials” (AdMas) represent the next technology frontier. According to the European Union, AdMas are materials that feature a series of exceptional properties or functionalities compared to conventional materials. Considering the progress made in the design and application of AdMas, their adverse effects are still largely unknown whilst this is critical for assessing their environmental and human health risk. In this perspective, we first summarize the available definitions/descriptions and categorizations that cover AdMas and evaluate their adequacy from a toxicological point of view. We further describe the challenges and outlook on the toxicology of AdMas and propose solutions to tackle some of the challenges. Criteria related to which AdMas might induce hazards are discussed and used to propose a starting point of how to address AdMas in legal frameworks that consider human and environmental risks. Finally, we highlight the benefit of classification, e.g., enabling differentiation between AdMas based on their properties that might induce specific hazards and facilitate a faster pathway to identify the hazards of new AdMas, which is particularly relevant for safe-by-design.}

The process of developing a blockchain-based application that fits user requirements largely depends on the selection of a suitable consensus protocol, which acts as the centerpiece of blockchain architecture. In distributed networks, consensus protocols not only help maintain data consistency among all stakeholders, but also allow users to work together and stay secure. However, limited efforts have been delivered to analyze and compare existing consensus protocols under various construction scenarios, leading to uncertainties when applying blockchain technology in the construction domain. Therefore, this paper performs a critical review extracting literatures from (1) blockchain-based applications in the construction industry, and (2) existing blockchain consensus protocols. Additionally, a mixed method that integrates qualitative and quantitative analysis is proposed to evaluate the suitability of mainstream consensus protocols for various construction-related applications. Based on the selection criteria and efficiency requirements of consensus protocols generated, a recommendation strategy is also presented for consensus protocol selection under different construction scenarios. This study contributes to the following: (1) it helps construction stakeholders to understand the consensus process in a specific construction application case, and (2) it provides lucid reference guidance in developing a robust blockchain-based system underlying an appropriate consensus protocol.}

abstract = {The global scope of pollution from plastic waste is a well-known phenomenon associated with trade, mass consumption, and disposal of plastic products (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), viral test kits, and vacuum-packaged food). Recently, the scale of the problem has been exacerbated by increases in indoor livelihood activities during lockdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study describes the effects of increased plastic waste on environmental footprint and human health. Further, the technological/regulatory options and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for sustainable plastic waste management are critically dealt in terms of their implications on energy resilience and circular economy. The abrupt increase in health-care waste during pandemic has been worsening environmental quality to undermine the sustainability in general. In addition, weathered plastic particles from PPE along with microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) can all adsorb chemical and microbial contaminants to pose a risk to ecosystems, biota, occupational safety, and human health. PPE-derived plastic pollution during the pandemic also jeopardizes sustainable development goals, energy resilience, and climate control measures. However, it is revealed that the pandemic can be regarded as an opportunity for explicit LCA to better address the problems associated with environmental footprints of plastic waste and to focus on sustainable management technologies such as circular bio-economies, biorefineries, and thermal gasification. Future researches in the energy-efficient clean technologies and circular bio-economies (or biorefineries) in concert with a “nexus” framework are expected to help reduce plastic waste into desirable directions.}

Therefore, UAVs security has attracted the interest of researchers in the field. To safeguard these leading devices, researchers and developers adopted artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the security system. Besides, emerging AI frameworks have entirely changed the landscape of UAVs quality of experience (QoE) by contributing to diverse issues. Meanwhile, owing to the novelty of the subject, AI-based frameworks for UAVs security were not carefully surveyed. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive survey of AI-based solutions for UAVs security provisioning through different techniques and algorithms. We assess and identify the recent AI solutions and the open research problems in the emerging field of UAV security. The study begins with an overview of UAV basics, their primary components, and the different communication links among networked UAVs. In addition, the paper explores UAVs security issues, threats, and attacks. This led to a discussion of proposed AI-based solutions for prevention and detection. Moreover, the paper categorizes AI-based solutions for UAV security and proposes a taxonomy to organize these approaches effectively. Finally, the review identifies open issues and future directions, offering valuable insights for researchers. The study methodology includes an extensive review of relevant publications in the past five years across UAVs, cyber-attacks, and AI. Therefore, this review presents an essential resource for understanding the current landscape of AI-based solutions for UAV security.}

The European Green Deal's ambitious targets have brought biodiversity and ecosystem condition restoration and conservation to the core of the EU's legislative portfolios. An opportunity to revisit some important governing texts with a biodiversity lens has therefore presented itself. In this study, we review the impacts on biodiversity and carbon emissions of specific bioenergy pathways that may be used to supply additional forest-based energy. We then synthesize our findings in a nexus matrix, plotting the pathways along a gradient of benefits through to detriments on the two dimensions to highlight win-win and lose-lose options. We found that some pathways do mitigate carbon emissions in the short-term while not deteriorating ecosystem condition. These include collecting fine woody debris within limits of locally established thresholds. We highlight the pathways that do little to mitigate carbon emissions and that are detrimental to ecosystems as well. These include removal of coarse woody debris and low stumps or the conversion of semi-natural, primary and old-growth forests to plantation forests with the purpose to produce bioenergy. We conclude that in the currently polarised debate an approach which unambiguously eliminates negative options is more fruitful than trying to find agreement on best options. Consequently, we present several governance measures that could limit the uptake of clearly undesirable pathways within Europe and we show that some lose-lose pathways are still considered “sustainable” within the European Green Deal.}

Before the pandemic, a marked portion of the adult population, more than 66%, owned smartphones, and approximately 15% owned wearables. The widespread use of such devices, along with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, has led to a transformation in health care culture that prioritizes cocreation, codesign, and collaboration. This shift promotes a model of health care centered on patient empowerment and self-management. In a recent interview with Dave deBronkart, known as e-Patient Dave, we revisited the possibilities of this new approach aimed at empowering, engaging, and equipping e-patients in the context of the pandemic. This interview with deBronkart was originally used for a graduate course on digital health. However, after noticing many reoccurring themes throughout the discussion, we decided to further explore this matter. It was discovered that participatory medicine is a new paradigm in health care, which challenges the conventional, paternalistic model and emphasizes the importance of a collaborative relationship between patients and providers. The realization of the full potential of health care can be achieved by promoting patient engagement and activation through the adoption of participatory medicine.}

There is a fine line between AI for good and AI for environmental degradation. Today, companies want to seize the benefits of AI, which distinctively involves reducing the company's carbon footprint. However, AI's carbon emissions differ as per the techniques involved in training it. As the saying goes, a coin always has two sides. Therefore, it cannot be denied that AI can be an effective tool for combating climate change, but its role in contributing to carbon emissions cannot be ignored. Multiple studies indicate that AI could be the game-changer in staving off anthropogenic climatic changes due to the deterioration of the environment and global warming. This double-edged relationship and interdependency of AI and carbon emissions are represented through a system of systems (SoS) approach. SoS states that a plan is created through multiple smaller systems, creating complexity in the design and vice versa. A complex system can be assumed as the world in general, where two individual independent systems AI and carbon emissions, when in interaction, create a complex complementary and contradictory relation, adding to the convolution of the system. This connection is demonstrated by conducting a network analysis and calculating the carbon emissions of six machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) models with different datasets but the same hyperparameters on a carbon emission calculator created through AI algorithms. The primary idea of this study is to encourage the AI society to create efficient AI models that may be used without compromising environmental issues. The focus should be on practicing sustainable AI, that is, sustainability from data collection to model deployment, throughout the lifecycle of AI.}

It reviews how the use of AI as presented in the literature fits into national, international, human and ecological security perspectives [1]. A national climate security discourse could emphasise military uses of AI and its role in propaganda and misinformation. The international security discourse suggests that international organisations can take advantage of AI to conduct their mission. However, transnational companies can also benefit from AI, with potential negative outcomes on consumption and resource extraction. Public–private collaboration for military AI grants transnational companies and states tools to hinder environmental movements. A human security discourse emphasises the role of AI in reaching the sustainable development goals but should consider potential power imbalances to prevent inequalities. Finally, an ecological understanding of climate security emphasises the role of algorithms in shaping our vision of the environment, and how it potentially estranges us from other cosmologies and the environmental impact of AI. This reflection opens avenues to explore the interplay between AI, geopolitics and environmental protection.}

The results reveal that LCC research has evolved into an integrated research system that is multidisciplinary, multidimensional, and multi-methodological. Energy is the most important topic in the field of LCC measure research throughout the surveyed period. Meanwhile, the low-carbon behaviors of urban residents and the application of digital technology have become relatively emerging research topics. Before 2010, LCC research was mainly conducted in the context of developed countries. However, since 2010, research conducted in the context of developing countries such as China has made substantial contributions, indicating the globalization trend of LCC research. Finally, future LCC measure research should significantly improve the study on small scales, integrate qualitative and quantitative research methods, and utilize advanced technologies such as GIS, IoT, and AI to improve data and result accuracy. Several aspects such as cross-sectoral collaborative management, comparison of low-carbon behaviors and awareness, and carbon sinks in urban natural ecosystems should be further improved.

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes a specific target for reducing businesses’ negative impacts on biodiversity and increasing their positive impacts to contribute toward the GBF mission and vision. “Nature Positive” is also emerging as a rallying call for mainstreaming the GBF. Merely tinkering with business as usual will not deliver these ambitions; transformative change is needed. However, how to operationalize transformative change toward Nature Positive and the GBF through meaningful actions and targets remains unclear, risking confusion, greenwashing, and failure to achieve global goals. This perspective draws on literature on social change to offer a practical framework for understanding and operationalizing transformative change for business toward a Nature Positive future. We define and describe the role of transformative change within a Nature Positive ambition and summarize the different types and scales of actions companies could take. This framework could help to plan mutually reinforcing actions and improve accountability for Nature Positive claims.}

In the adoption phase, we identified eight internal drivers and seven external drivers, together with comprehensive barriers. Our framework also integrates and examines the blockchain technology application stage, focusing not only on the current development of benefits of blockchain technology implementation but also on the challenges that impede the successful implementation of blockchain technology in supply chain management. The future development prospects are also highlighted which include standardization, platform development, regulation system development, cost reduction, and talent cultivation.

Floods and droughts, which happen more frequently and intensely, significantly and negatively influence agricultural production. The objective of the meta-analysis is to identify impacts on various sectors, adaptation strategies, and the challenges of climate change in the Ethiopian context. Twenty-three peer-reviewed articles were identified from ScienceDirect and Web of Science, followed by PRISMA guidelines, and analyzed using Stata version 13. The results reveal that climate change negatively impacts agriculture (by changing crop suitability, phenology, and productivity), the environment, and society, resulting from shifting temperature and rainfall patterns. Temperature variations, patterns of precipitation, and severe weather conditions have profound implications for agricultural productivity, water resources, ecosystems, and human well-being, which are multifaceted and interlinked. In addition, the reviewed articles informed us that farmers have used different coping strategies in response to climate change, such as soil and water conservation, agroforestry practices, integrated soil fertility management, small-scale irrigation, the application of improved crop varieties, the use of improved livestock, mixed cropping, early and late planting, and the practice of income-generating activities. The random effects meta-regression result shows that effective implementation of the above-mentioned practices reduces the risk of climate change in different sectors. The assessment also points out many challenges to the realization of these approaches, such as the lack of financing, institutional support, insufficient stakeholder involvement, ecological and sociocultural factors, and limited access to weather information. The meta-analysis concludes that addressing challenges requires holistic and integrated approaches that encompass adaptation strategies, sustainable land and water management, and social resilience-building to help the resilience of Ethiopian communities and ecosystems in the face of a changing climate.}

In response, these countries are implementing Nature-based Solution to minimize these challenges and promote sustainable development. In this article we analyze the NbS programs implemented across the Himalayan region and assess the limitations of these NbS using the IUCN standard criteria of adherence to NbS for selected articles. We perform a systematic review of articles using the PRISMA methodology, through the Scopus, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases and followed by screening through the Rayyan web interface. Articles were screened out based on the location and lack of biodiversity and human well-being outcomes of NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions in the Himalayas primarily use a sustainable management approach (35.29%), followed by restoration (23.53%), conservation (11.76%), holistic management (11.76%), eco-DRR (11.76%) and green infrastructure (5.88%) to address societal and climatic challenges. Institutional execution of NbS was 29.41% more common compared to the implementation of NbS by community or farmer groups. Pineapple based agroforestry (83.04%), forest restoration (78.57%), spring water storage (83.04%), spring restoration (86.61%), groundwater recharge (82.14%), bio-fertilizer and pesticides (77.68%), watershed restoration (78.57%), community-based watershed management (77.68%), community-based DRR (81.25%), community-based forest management (81.25%), sustainable harvest of medicinal plants (77.68%) and wetland restoration (82.14%), adhere to the IUCN criteria. In addition, some interventions adequately meet IUCN criteria, such as ice stupas (72.32%), forest restoration through plantation (73.21%), eco-safe roads (65.18), blue-green infrastructure (68.75%), and traditional ecological knowledge (72.32%). Our evaluation noted that NbS interventions can be improved by precise planning and design before implementation, engaging multiple stakeholders, comparing alternative solutions, and periodic monitoring of the impacts on the environment and society. This study shows that NbS in the Himalayas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and climate risk management. Tackling the limitation of this present review, mainly the exclusion of research not addressing biodiversity and human well-being, will yield more precise outcomes for climate actions and sustainable development.}

Innovations and efficiencies in digital technology have lately been depicted as paramount in the green transition to enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, both in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and the wider economy. This, however, fails to adequately account for rebound effects that can offset emission savings and, in the worst case, increase emissions. In this perspective, we draw on a transdisciplinary workshop with 19 experts from carbon accounting, digital sustainability research, ethics, sociology, public policy, and sustainable business to expose the challenges of addressing rebound effects in digital innovation processes and associated policy. We utilize a responsible innovation approach to uncover potential ways forward for incorporating rebound effects in these domains, concluding that addressing ICT-related rebound effects ultimately requires a shift from an ICT efficiency-centered perspective to a “systems thinking” model, which aims to understand efficiency as one solution among others that requires constraints on emissions for ICT environmental savings to be realized.}

Telemedicine is a promising solution to the challenges of delivering equitable and quality primary healthcare, especially in LMICs. This review evaluated peer-reviewed literature on telehealth interventions in Indian primary care published from Jan 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2021, from PubMed, Scopus, TRIP, Google Scholar, Indian Kanoon, and Cochrane database The majority of Indian studies focus on key health issues like maternal and child health, mental health, diabetes, infectious diseases, and hypertension, mainly through patient education, monitoring, and diagnostics. Yet, there’s a lack of research on telemedicine’s cost-effectiveness, communication among providers, and the role of leadership in its quality and accessibility. The current research has gaps, including small sample sizes and inconsistent methodologies, which hamper the evaluation of telemedicine’s effectiveness. India's varied healthcare landscape, technological limitations, and social factors further challenge telemedicine's adoption. Despite regulatory efforts, issues like the digital divide and data privacy persist. Addressing these challenges with a context-aware, technologically driven approach is crucial for enhancing healthcare through telemedicine in India.}

abstract = {Cities respond to climate concerns mainly through climate action plans (CAPs). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was the first report from the international climate body that gave worldwide attention to urban climate change. Yet, a global situation of the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published after AR5 is not well represented in the literature. This literature void presents a difficulty in holistically understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing urban CAPs, hence painting a clearer picture for future urban climate planning. Here, we performed detailed qualitative content analyses on CAPs from 278 cities worldwide. This study sought to achieve two specific objectives; (1) to critically analyse the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published from 2015 to 2022, and (2) to examine the extent to which sampled urban CAPs align with selected climate action best practices. There have been variations in the adoption or publication of urban CAPs from 2015 to 2022 across city types and world regions. Our analysis showed a rise in the number of CAPs adopted or published during the global COVID-19 lockdown period as compared to the post and pre-COVID-19 lockdown period. We also observed a transition from developing mainly mitigation-focused CAPs pre-COP21 to both mitigation and adaptation CAPs. About 96% of the sampled urban CAPs are focusing on the transport sector to achieve climate objectives. More than half (55%) of cities with climate change mitigation-related urban CAPs (147 urban CAPs of 267 urban CAPs) do not have deep decarbonization pledges, with less than a quarter of the pledges likely to be achieved by 2030. We found that about 81% of 120 cities with deep decarbonization pledges are more likely to report baseline emission inventory in their urban CAPs. A lack of inclusiveness, transparency and verification, evidence-based climate planning, comprehensiveness, and integration were the most common areas of non-alignment with best practices. The explicit consideration of synergies, trade-offs, or conflicts is significantly low. The evidence is a catalyst for understanding the dynamics in existing urban CAPs to shape future urban climate action planning.}

However, WTE-T adoption is hindered by financial uncertainties. The economic benefits of MSW treatment and energy generation must be balanced against environmental impact. Integrating cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance MSW management strategies and facilitate WTE-T adoption. This review paper explores waste classification, generation, and disposal methods, emphasizing public awareness to reduce waste. It discusses AI's role in waste management, including route optimization, waste composition forecasting, and process parameter optimization for energy generation. Various energy production techniques from MSW, such as high-solids anaerobic digestion, torrefaction, plasma pyrolysis, incineration, gasification, biodegradation, and hydrothermal carbonization, are examined for their advantages and challenges. The paper emphasizes risk assessment in MSW management, covering chemical, mechanical, biological, and health-related risks, aiming to identify and mitigate potential adverse effects. Electronic waste (E-waste) impact on human health and the environment is thoroughly discussed, highlighting the release of hazardous substances and their contribution to air, soil, and water pollution. The paper advocates for circular economy (CE) principles and waste-to-energy solutions to achieve sustainable waste management. It also addresses complexities and constraints faced by developing nations and proposes strategies to overcome them. In conclusion, this comprehensive review underscores the importance of risk assessment, the potential of AI and waste-to-energy solutions, and the need for sustainable waste management to safeguard public health and the environment.}

These are unintentionally overshadowing others such as food security, increase of human population, preservation of natural ecosystems, water scarcity and reliability of energy supply, amongst others. This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy. This new biodiplomacy should have the courage to develop and act in the interests of the human population overall, and not be undone by the legitimate but narrower interests of any single national priority. This article concludes by highlighting some of the key elements needed to give a biodiplomacy a chance to address, effectively, responsibly and synergistically, the current global challenges that affect mankind.}

Interest in leveraging real-world evidence (RWE) to support regulatory decision making for product effectiveness has been increasing globally as evident by the increasing number of regulatory frameworks and guidance documents. However, acceptance of RWE, especially before marketing for regulatory approval, differs across countries. In addition, guidance on the design and conduct of innovative clinical trials, such as randomized controlled registry studies, pragmatic trials, and other hybrid studies, is lacking.
Methods
We assessed the global regulatory environment with regard to RWE based on regional availability of the following 3 key regulatory elements: (1) RWE regulatory framework, (2) data quality and standards guidance. and (3) study methods guidance.
Findings
This article reviews the available frameworks and existing guidance from across the globe and discusses the observed gaps and opportunities for further development and harmonization.
Implications
Cross-country collaborations are encouraged to further shape and align RWE policies and help establish frameworks in countries without current policies with the goal of creating efficiencies when considering RWE to support regulatory decision-making globally.}

This understanding is crucial for energy transitions dependent on households using technology to support the energy system. A sample of energy research studies conducted in OECD countries and sourced using a systematised literature search identifies a broad range of influences on household adoption and rejection of energy technologies. Thematic analysis organises these influences into a simple and accessible framework comprising five psychosocial categories: cognitive; social; affective; behavioural; and contextual. This contrasts starkly with the one-dimensional consumer archetypes found to dominate energy sector thinking on household energy transitions, which lack any behavioural realism. Applying this framework identifies affective influences – uncertainty, control, trust – as a key difference between findings for rejection rather than adoption, and innovative rather than established technologies. Key differences are also observed in studies comparing early adopters and mainstream consumers, whose participation in the future energy system is crucial. A novel meta-regression application demonstrates the potential for this new framework to improve the behavioural realism of future energy transitions work by energy researchers, practitioners and policymakers. The results of this review have three main implications. 1. Using the framework to broaden the range of influences on household decisions will improve energy sector's ability to engage households in energy transitions. 2. Understanding mainstream consumer rejection of innovative technologies is key to accelerating household participation in energy systems. 3. A concerted effort is needed to engage households excluded from energy transition benefits by market-based approaches.}

This paper analyzes IoT adoption by organizations, and identifies IoT benefits and risks. A Big, Open, Linked Data (BOLD) categorization of the expected benefits and risks of IoT is made by conducting a comprehensive literature study. In-depth case studies in the field of asset management were then executed to examine the actual experienced, real world benefits and risks. The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions between organization and technology. The results confirm the duality that gaining the benefits of IoT in asset management produces unexpected social changes that lead to structural transformation of the organization. IoT can provide organizations with many benefits, after having dealt with unexpected risks and making the necessary organizational changes. There is a need to introduce changes to the organization, processes and systems, to develop capabilities and ensure that IoT fits the organization’s purposes.}

In light of the increasing vulnerability to drought occurrences and the heightened impact of drought-related disasters on numerous communities, it is imperative for drought-sensitive sectors to adopt proactive measures. This involves the implementation of early warning systems to effectively mitigate potential risks. Guided by Toulmin’s model of argumentation, this research proposes a framework of eight interconnected modules introducing Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to enhance drought early warning capabilities. The framework emphasizes the Internet of Things, drones, big data analytics, and deep learning for real-time monitoring and accurate drought forecasts. Another key component is the role of natural language processing in analyzing data from unstructured sources, such as social media, and reviews, essential for improving alerts, dissemination, and interoperability. While the framework optimizes resource use in agriculture, water, and the environment, overcoming impending limitations is crucial; hence, practical implementation and amendment of policies are necessary.}

abstract = {Efficiently managing liquid organic waste (LOW) is imperative for tackling the global challenges of waste accumulation, deteriorated environmental conditions, and rising healthcare costs. Within this context, the circular economy has emerged as a pivotal focus in scientific agendas worldwide, offering innovative solutions for LOW management with minimal environmental impact. A systematic review of 385 scientific communications was conducted employing the latest PRISMA methodology, with no time gap. Additionally, 46 reports, protocols, guidelines, country reports, and publications from international organizations such as the UN, World Bank, WHO, IEA, UNEP, EPA, EC, and EEA were referenced. The study seeks to resolve the ambiguity around LOW by defining LOW based on fundamental characteristics of high nutrient and moisture content, potential for sustainable agriculture, and management risk including pollution threat; and categorizing it into food waste, livestock, agro-industrial, and municipal waste. The study investigates different waste stream sources, their physiochemical features, appropriate processing technologies, end-products, and potential applications. The research critically examines the design configurations, and optimal processing technologies such as biological, thermal, biochemical, hydrothermal, and electro-biochemical methods. Majority of the commercial plants are biochemical plants using anaerobic digestion, evidencing greater potential for co-digestion. Unlike solid waste or wastewater management, the scope for biological and thermal processing techniques is limited with most of the plants still in lab scale. The study underscores the crucial need to transition to circular economy and resource efficiency for sustainability. The study demonstrates how LOW management aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing water pollution, health, and climate action. Proposing a strategic framework for managing LOW encompassing technology, policies, markets, and the economy, with stakeholders' involvement considering social, economic, regulatory, and governance factors, the research discusses potential limitations in LOW disposal and advocates viable solutions for strategic liquid organic waste management. Integrated LOW management, policy coherence, comprehensive environmental laws, waste management regulation revisions, solution-oriented innovation, and nexus thinking will be required to move forward. In a rapidly changing environment, this information will assist policymakers and stakeholders in identifying research gaps and establishing effective liquid organic waste management strategies to promote sustainable development.}

Secondly, it points out that the coupling characteristics of UIES have a dual impact on resilience. The definition of UIES resilience can be understood from three perspectives, namely partial resilience versus total resilience, physical resilience versus digital resilience, and current resilience versus future resilience. Thirdly, this review summarizes the strategies for improving the resilience of UIES across three distinct stages, namely before, during, and after extreme events. The resilience of UIES can be enhanced by effective measures to prediction, adaptation, and assessment. Finally, the challenges faced by management of resilient UIES are presented and discussed, in terms of mitigating compound risks, modeling complex systems, addressing data collection and quality issue, and collaborating within multi stakeholders.}

The increased pilot LCCs in several countries and focus on theoretical research suggest the need to explore the associated research topics and characteristics, trends, and challenges. An in-depth analysis of literature on LCCs was conducted using the three-phase research involving documents searching, quantitative analyses and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis revealed that nearly 70% of LCC research was conducted in three countries. The results of the quantitative analysis also generated a map of term clusters, which identified the 9 major areas. A qualitative analysis of the literature indicated that transition to low-carbon energy is the most intensively researched category, and LCC planning and design dominates the research field. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, this study reports knowledge gaps in the literature and proposes future directions for LCC research in the context of four major trends: LCC planning and design, low-carbon energy transition, low-carbon decision support, and low-carbon management and policy. This study improves the existing knowledge on LCC-related research and provides a future guidance for theoretical research and pilot practices related to LCC.}

There is currently a pressing need to develop best practices to minimise the potential environmental impacts of this new industry. Project-specific environmental management processes, such as environmental impact assessment (EIA), and the associated environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP), must be effective to sufficiently mitigate environmental impacts of deep-sea mining (DSM) projects. This paper identifies the key drivers, barriers, and enablers to polymetallic nodule mining from a review of recent literature and develops an environmental management framework prior to any exploitation licenses being approved. We explore how the drivers to polymetallic nodule mining are framed in a global context, including claims that it will facilitate clean energy transitions, increase mineral supply diversity, and improve life cycle sustainability. We highlight the key barriers to effective environmental management, including epistemic uncertainty about deep-sea ecosystems, assessment of harmful effects from mining activities, and stakeholder support for a social license. We identify three enablers, including the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, and adaptive management, all of which are highly interdependent and must be operationalised to address the identified barriers. The results of this analysis indicate a complex social-ecological narrative infused throughout recent literature, emphasising the need for systems-level thinking and broader stakeholder participation. We present an environmental management framework designed to support good industry practice and guide future research.}

This study provides the first systematic review of material-energy nexus literature published between 2002 and 2022, emphasising the interconnections and feedback loops between material and energy systems. The global knowledge-stock is comprehensively assessed regarding research focus, sustainability challenges, and corresponding circular economy strategies. Additionally, significant gaps in the research agenda and key policy implications for both material consuming-developed countries and producing-developing countries are proposed. Findings of this study underscore the vital role of international cooperation in managing primary and secondary material supply chains, grounded in the “common but differentiated responsibilities” principle under the Paris Agreement. Consuming-developed countries should support producing-developing countries in building renewable energy capacity, optimising energy saving technologies and measures, and adhering to high environmental standards for resources extraction and production. Meanwhile, both consuming-developed countries and producing-developing countries should take domestic mitigation measures. The former should focus on changing consumption behaviour, and the latter on increasing resource efficiency.}

Therefore, the gap between policies and their implementation in the workplace causes the failure of the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. To provide a clear picture, the present study intends to investigate the factors that might foster/hinder the adoption of sustainable policies in business practices. The study provides a systematic literature review on sustainable business policies from 2015 to 2023. We consider what are the key factors supporting or obstructing the successful implementation of a sustainability framework in the business practices in SMEs. Our findings reveal that data-centered solutions, sensor aided cyber physical systems, green consumption, vendor support, technological roadmap, gain legitimacy on the use of data analytics, and acceleration of digital transformation are the most significant enablers for sustainable business practices in SMEs. In addition, cloud enterprise resource planning is found to be the most significant enabler for developing countries. The barriers are mainly related to the implantation of the enablers. Among those major barriers are security of the data storage, lack of trust, lack of top management support, resistance to change to the new technology, lack of skilled workforce, data breaches, and poor network security. Our findings have key policy implications for practitioners and policy makers.}

This has led organizations around the globe to seek new approaches to protect their enterprise network. One such approach is the adoption of the Zero Trust security approach due to its many advantages over the traditional/perimeter security approach. Although zero trust presents a stronger defense approach over the perimeter security model, organizations are hesitant to fully embrace it. This is partly due to the lack of a unified zero-trust implementation framework that can be used to guide its adoption. As such, we conducted a multivocal review that included literature from both academic and non-academic sources to consolidate knowledge on the state-of-the-art of zero-trust implementation and identify gaps in literature. Our result shows that existing papers tend to have a narrow viewpoint on the approach of implementing zero trust, rather than an encompassing viewpoint that can provide a more holistic view on the topic. We developed a conceptual framework that articulates the five core components involved in the implementation of zero trust security, guided by key questions designed to guide the implementation process.}

Information-based regulation is an increasingly popular type of instrument that refers to the use of ratings, rankings, labels, online inventories and similar public disclosure practices by regulators. Such schemes vary in their design, disclosure formats, mechanisms to influence behaviour and performance. Theoretical and practical questions remain about whether and how regulators can use voluntary and/or beyond compliance disclosures. The article develops a classification of information-based schemes based on whether the scheme is mandatory or voluntary, and whether the disclosures reveal compliance or beyond compliance performance behaviours. The classification is used to show how the different schemes (traditional, assurance, performance and proactive) work in practice with their associated risks, benefits and mechanisms. While regulators are experimenting with this new frontier of regulation, it is not yet clear whether all types of schemes will be sufficiently robust to deliver on the promise they hold for enthusiasts of smart regulation. We conclude with implications and future research questions on the nature of voluntariness and compliance in information-based regulation.}

Urban areas are a critical piece of the puzzle to achieve the energy transition and reach the ambitious climate targets set out at global and European scales. Positive energy districts (PEDs), a new concept introduced in 2018 by the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, constitute a bottom-up response to this massive problematic and an opportunity to accelerate the transition towards low-carbon energy models in cities. However, their deployment is currently facing a set of diverse and complex challenges, mainly arising from their novelty and the lack of practical experience. In that context, the contribution of the present review of the literature is twofold. First, it seeks to provide a broad perspective of the advances of the research on PEDs with a special focus on applied studies and practical experiences. Then, it aims to identify substantial challenges that are currently slowing down PEDs effective operationalization, and study to what extent researchers and practitioners are currently approaching them. To that end, 135 papers are selected, categorized, and analysed according to their topics, locations, climates, districts, studied solutions and social concerns. As a result, the paper gives an overview of the main trends and necessities of PEDs research and practice and draws recommendations on how to adequately address identified challenges.}

abstract = {Most of the developed and developing countries around the world are delving into the implementation of demand response (DR) strategies in demand side management (DSM) to meet the needs of their own power industry and customers. Some major segments of demand response strategies are, customer segmentation, demand/price forecasting to design customer-oriented dynamic tariff that influences the customer engagement in those strategies. One of the crucial factors that influence customer engagement in those strategies is the input variables or attributes selected to conduct precise customer segmentation, which leads to precise and more accurate demand/price forecasting to design customer-centric dynamic tariff. Most of the existing literature focused on either one of those segments but a collective review on all these segments, particularly focusing on the methods and market attributes, is yet to be conducted. This study reviews the recent existing literature on customer segmentation, demand/price forecasting, customer engagement strategies for dynamic tariff design in power industry to map out the appropriate methods for respective input attributes from the electricity market. For this purpose, the input attributes in the electricity market have been divided into six broad categories and for each attribute category, appropriate methods have been illustrated through a proposed framework based on existing literature.}

Data collection and processing via digital public health technologies are being promoted worldwide by governments and private companies as strategic remedies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and loosening lockdown measures. However, the ethical and legal boundaries of deploying digital tools for disease surveillance and control purposes are unclear, and a rapidly evolving debate has emerged globally around the promises and risks of mobilising digital tools for public health. To help scientists and policy makers to navigate technological and ethical uncertainty, we present a typology of the primary digital public health applications that are in use. These include proximity and contact tracing, symptom monitoring, quarantine control, and flow modelling. For each, we discuss context-specific risks, cross-sectional issues, and ethical concerns. Finally, recognising the need for practical guidance, we propose a navigation aid for policy makers and other decision makers for the ethical development and use of digital public health tools.}

This paper presents a research review of the evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based studies on different energy-related aspects, including the traditional energy utilizations, energy saving and carbon emission reduction, new energy utilizations, new energy vehicles, electric power market, distributed energy systems, micro-grid, smart grid and energy storage. Typical research works based on the evolutionary game theory method and relevant algorithms are introduced and summarized. To promote the sustainable developments of energy utilization technologies as well as the usage of evolutionary game theory method, typical existing problems and several general recommendations about the further EGT-based research works are also proposed. The potential further works based on the evolutionary game theory approach may include the EGT-based studies considering more complex initial conditions and influential factors, verifications of the applicabilities and feasibilities of the evolutionary game theory method based on practical examples, research works with evolutionary game models consisting of more participants, and research and development (R&D) works of new EGT-based or hybrid algorithms.}

abstract = {Introduction
To achieve Universal Health Coverage and the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda for 2030, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended the use of social enterprise, digital technology, and citizen engagement in the delivery of Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS) as part of its strategic vision for 21st century primary care.
Methods
We conducted a hermeneutic review of frameworks, models and theories on social enterprise, digital health, citizen engagement and IPCHS. This involved multiple iterative cycles of (i) searching and acquisition, followed by (ii) critical analysis and interpretation of literature to assemble arguments and evidence for conceptual relationships until information saturation was reached. This process identified a set of constructs which we synthesised into a testable framework.
Results
Several interdisciplinary frameworks, models and theories explain how social enterprises could use digital technology, and citizen engagement to enable the technical and social integration required to facilitate people-centred primary care. Innovative approaches can be used to maintain financial sustainability while delivering IPCHS at lower cost to vulnerable and marginalised populations in both developed and developing countries.
Conclusion
This framework provides a theoretical grounding to guide empirical inquiry into how social enterprises use digital technology to engage citizens in co-producing IPCHS.}
