abstract = {Food loss and waste (FLW) contains an abundance of nutrient components that can be extracted and converted into valuable bioproducts through biorefining (e.g., pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nutrients). Australia has identified bioproducts from a FLW feedstock as one avenue through which it can meet its commitment to UN Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3, aiming to halve food waste by 2030. An industry for bioproducts in Australia is, however, nascent and will require targeted and sustained policy intervention to advance in line with the production targets it has set to meet Target 12.3. The aim of this critical review is threefold. Firstly, it draws on the research literature to identify barriers to advancing a bioproduct industry from FLW. Secondly, it constructs a taxonomy of policies available to overcome these barriers and support industry development. Finally, it applies the taxonomy to established policy settings in Australia (examining both national settings and Queensland state settings) and the European Union (EU), where the industry and associated policy is more mature. Australia has few national policies directly targeting a bioproduct industry. A comparative assessment of policy settings allows this review to identify lessons Australia can draw from the EU experience as it advances its own industry. Findings demonstrate a complex and fragmented policy landscape. Key recommendations from the literature emphasise the need to establish coordinated strategic instruments; target research and development opportunities for optimised, sustainable processes; and implement appropriate incentives to establish a ‘level playing field’, as technology readiness increases. The critical requirement for policy stability and coherence, flags the need to lay groundwork policy in this area as a priority.}

However, with several additional interests and priorities relating to sustainability, the job of finding common ground in collaboration becomes more complex compared to conventional housing and neighborhood projects. Moreover, the type of stakeholders involved and the issues they are concerned with change as the project develops. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of empirical-based research found in the intersection between stakeholder collaboration and sustainable neighborhood projects. Our comprehensive systematic review of the past 20 years’ extant literature revealed 20 main themes impacting stakeholder collaboration spread over the stages of project development. Building on the various themes, we summarized several factors that support collaboration capacity in SN projects, and that can ultimately lead to different trajectories for sustainability outcomes over time. Furthermore, the review revealed several potential avenues for research, which may help improve our understanding of the mechanics and interaction of stakeholder involvement in SN projects.}

abstract = {Community-based energy systems are gaining traction among policymakers and practitioners as promising models for implementing a low-carbon energy transition. As a result, there has been a proliferation of concepts in the scientific literature, such as community energy, energy communities, community solar, and community wind. However, what scholars mean by “community” in these contexts is often unclear and inconsistent. This paper provides further conceptual clarity in the field by analyzing how the term of community is conceptualized in the scholarly literature on energy systems, through a systematic review of 405 articles. We combine an author keyword network analysis of this corpus with an in-depth analysis of 183 definitions extracted from these articles and systematically coded across three dimensions: meanings, activities and objectives of communities. Our findings show that the meanings attached to the notion of community and the alleged objectives pursued by communities vary substantially across concepts and over time. In particular, there has been a shift away from a notion of community understood as a process that emphasizes participatory aspects toward a notion of community primarily referring to a place. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on communities' economic objectives rather than their social or political goals. These findings suggest a weakening of scholars’ attention to “transformative” notions of community emphasizing collective and grassroots processes of participation in energy transitions, to the benefit of “instrumental” notions. This trend runs the risk of placing the sole emphasis on the market value of communities, thereby diluting their distinctiveness from more commercial actors.}

The paper offers a review of EU energy policies spanning over the last half century with a focus on policy instruments to encourage measures on energy efficiency in new and existing buildings. Starting from early policies set by the EU in response to the Oil Embargo in the 1973, the paper discusses the impact of EU policies in stimulating energy efficiency improvements in the building sector ranging from the SAVE Directive to the recently 2018 updated Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and Energy Efficiency Directive. The review explores the progress made over the last 50 years in addressing energy efficiency in buildings and highlights successes as well as remaining challenges. It discusses the impact of political priorities in reshaping how energy efficiency is addressed by EU policymakers, leading to a holistic approach to buildings, and provides insights and suggestions on how to further exploit the EU potential to save energy from buildings.}

The paper discusses recent advances for ethical AI and suggests a pathway from ethical norms towards standards. As it is argued, taking the responsible AI approach is promising when tackling the main ethic-related challenges of Cyber-Physical Production Systems. We expose a number of dilemmas to be resolved so that AI systems incorporated in CPPS cause no damages either in humans, equipment or in the environment and increase the trust in the users of current and future AI technologies.}

The BBB concept is broadly focused on housing. BBB Critical Infrastructure (CI) has received less attention and is still considered an emerging topic. The accumulation of knowledge about the concept and how to guide its application is in relatively short supply. To this end, this review paper presents a broad and structured state-of-the-art of the BBB CI concept. Being one of a few studies in a rather underexplored area of research, the main aim is to accelerate the accumulation and assimilation of BBB CI knowledge into the existing body of knowledge and unlock research needs. Reviewing existing research revealed trends, conceptual definitions, implementation aspects, frameworks, significant gaps, unanswered questions and perspectives for future research, connecting both theory and practice of BBB CI. A key result showed that theoretical themes are highly controversial, translating into contextual constraints that hamper the application of BBB CI. Perspectives for research lines of work that could be potent elements to overcome these constraints and further drive forward BBB CI are presented.}

Additionally, manufacturing automation has led to mass production and consumption, triggering waste production. The existing linear economy approach has led to increasing waste production and resource depletion, posing significant environmental and public health threats. To overcome these impediments, an alternative model called the circular economy concept has gained popularity in the global industry community. This closed-loop, restorative, waste-free concept has the potential to protect the environment and improve economics by reducing energy and resource consumption. Thus, major impetus should be given to strengthening the backbone of the economy where tools such as green technologies, decarbonization strategies, bio refinery processes, material flow analysis, life cycle assessment, ecological footprints (water, carbon, and material), substance flow analysis, circularity index, eco-designing, bioresource management, new business models, and policy play an essential role in the areas of socio-economic sustainability, ecological facts, and industrial aspects to enhance socio-economic growth in a sustainable manner.

To scrutinize such participatory processes within the climate and energy fields, we conducted a critical systematic review of 183 records, which includes scientific publications, but also other initiatives coming from the public administration or the non-profit sector. First, we unpack six aspects of co-production: (1) the different levels of participation; (2) the emerging topics and issues; (3) the scale and location at which initiatives are conducted; (4) the actors who take part in the processes; (5) the different methods and tools for participation and (6) the outcomes and transformational potential of the initiatives. Our results show that real co-production is still far from being mainstream, with consultation still accounting for a majority of initiatives. Themes remain focused on the mitigation sphere, a tendency related to a majority of the records happening in developed countries. However, we also observe new categories of actors challenging traditional decision-making, as well as emerging methods and tools opening the space for more social innovation and participation. Following, in our critical analysis, we argue that there is a crucial need for a better interconnection between science and policy (especially at national and international scales) and that a reflection on transformation is fundamental when planning any participatory initiative. We finally claim that, despite not being a silver bullet, meaningful citizen participation constitutes a viable alternative to tackle today's complex problems.}

The reliability of these assessments is critical for achieving future energy targets. However, there is evidence of a significant Energy Performance Gap (EPG) in buildings, defined as the difference between measured and calculated energy consumption. This work performs a systematic review of EPG causes and reduction strategies in the context of heating of residential buildings. It introduces the concept of “optimal” consumption, in contrast to “theoretical” (i.e. calculated with standards) and “actual” (i.e. measured) consumption, which enables a more rigorous classification of causes and potential solutions to the EPG. This review found that inaccuracies in modelling of building characteristics and occupant behaviour has been most studied by researchers. It found that many EPG reduction strategies have been proposed, which can be categorized into two groups. The first aims to improve the energy consumption calculation by correcting the standard assumptions and/or considering new approaches to create energy certificates. The second group focuses on improving the actual performance of the building’s energy systems, through better monitoring, maintenance, and general usage of the building. A range of practical strategies were identified, which are relevant to a range of stakeholder groups. At the same time, this work also highlights that understanding of the relative importance of EPG causes and the potential impact of the corresponding solutions is incomplete.}

abstract = {This paper identifies the Circular Value Chain Blind Spot in consumer behavior research on Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). A scoping review was conducted to ascertain the current state of research regarding consumer behavior in handling WEEE concerning circular or transformational and linear behaviors. By evaluating 122 articles from databases including Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and ProQuest the findings reveal a notable focus on three key strategies among the 9 R framework: recycle, repair, and reuse. Recycling emerges as the predominant area of research, while circular transformation strategies and linear concepts are also explored. Unexpectedly, concrete consumer action strategies are underrepresented, with a primary emphasis on companies and governments. As consumers are recognized as crucial actors within the circular economy (CE), this paper terms this contradictory state as the Circular Value Chain Blind Spot. Addressing future research, the paper concludes with a comprehensive research agenda encompassing six key areas: nudging, differentiation, systemic perspective, waste hierarchy, value chain strategies, and cultural factors. By adopting this research agenda, we anticipate overcoming the Circular Value Chain Blind Spot and fostering equal consideration of all stakeholders involved in the WEEE problematic.}

Improved upstream primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) would enable more individuals to lead lives free of CVD. However, there remain limitations in the current provision of CVD primary prevention, where artificial intelligence (AI) may help to fill the gaps. Using the data informatics capabilities at the National University Health System (NUHS), Singapore, empowered by the Endeavour AI system, and combined large language model (LLM) tools, our team has created a real-time dashboard able to capture and showcase information on cardiovascular risk factors at both individual and geographical level- CardioSight. Further insights such as medication records and data on area-level socioeconomic determinants allow a whole-of-systems approach to promote healthcare delivery, while also allowing for outcomes to be tracked effectively. These are paired with interventions, such as the CHronic diseAse Management Program (CHAMP), to coordinate preventive cardiology care at a pilot stage within our university health system. AI tools in synergy allow the identification of at-risk patients and actionable steps to mitigate their health risks, thereby closing the gap between risk identification and effective patient care management in a novel CVD prevention workflow.}

Data-driven digital health technologies have the power to transform health care. If these tools could be sustainably delivered at scale, they might have the potential to provide everyone, everywhere, with equitable access to expert-level care, narrowing the global health and wellbeing gap. Conversely, it is highly possible that these transformative technologies could exacerbate existing health-care inequalities instead. In this Viewpoint, we describe the problem of health data poverty: the inability for individuals, groups, or populations to benefit from a discovery or innovation due to a scarcity of data that are adequately representative. We assert that health data poverty is a threat to global health that could prevent the benefits of data-driven digital health technologies from being more widely realised and might even lead to them causing harm. We argue that the time to act is now to avoid creating a digital health divide that exacerbates existing health-care inequalities and to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era.}

Much of the cost is on inadequate facility operations that may be avoided. Utilizing the theoretical lens of the adaptive structuration theory, this rapid evidence assessment shall review the current body of scholarly literature to identify how artificial intelligence can be used with predictive maintenance to reduce a facility operations program's operations and maintenance costs. Through an organized systematic review process, this research shall utilize peer-reviewed scholarly articles published within the last 5 years to perform a rapid evidence assessment of predictive maintenance and artificial intelligence in facility operations. Through this rapid evidence assessment, the research finds three common themes that respond to the research question. The most significant theme is artificial intelligence, once implemented in the process, provides unbiased investment and repair recommendations from the analyzed data. An unanticipated discovery of interest is that the current body of literature identifies insufficient data as the number one barrier to the full implementation of artificial intelligence within a facility operations program.}

abstract = {This study explores the role of Energy Retrofit (ER) in Low Carbon Transition (LCT). The literature recognises the need to move towards a transdisciplinary approach in ER, which encompasses multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. However, the fragmentation between different disciplines remains a significant problem, mainly due to challenges associated with knowledge exchange across the allied disciplines that play a role in ER. The authors posit that ER projects has been conceptualised and implemented using a Systems perspective so that an integrated approach that is akin to transdisciplinarity could become commonplace. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to establish to what extent ER has been conceptualised as a System in the literature so that complexities can effectively be managed through a transdisciplinary approach. This work is based on a literature review of 136 peer-reviewed journal papers. The content analysis demonstrates that current research on transdisciplinarity in ER can be conceptualised in five categories and 15 lines of research. They are presented as a Conceptual Framework, which is this paper’s main contribution to existing knowledge. It reveals the direction of innovation in ER for LCT, and is illustrated as a cognitive map. This map exposes the current fragmentation implicit in the literature, and proposes critical connections that need to be established for a transdisciplinary approach. It also shows that the discourse on LCT changed by moving beyond the building scale; and recognising the need to embrace disruptive and local technologies, and integrating the social and technical aspects of ER. Innovative technical solutions and robust information modelling approaches emerge as key vehicles towards making decisions that pay regard to the economic, social and technical factors and that empower the prosumers to play an active role in LCT.}

abstract = {There is a strong consent among scholars and policy makers that limiting current global energy demand and gradually reducing it towards a sustainable level of consumption is a key component of any strategies and pathways to reach the Paris Agreement climate target, and, in particular, carbon neutrality by mid-century. Given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase of energy demand, in addition to investments in energy efficiency technologies, there is the need for a change of energy end-users behaviour and life style to obtain additional energy savings by limiting the demand for services. Traditionally, energy efficiency policies have mainly targeted and promoted energy efficient technologies (e.g., energy performance standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, financial incentives for new technologies, etc.). In some cases, the energy savings achieved have been less than expected, due to a rebound effect, or because external factors (e.g., growth in populations or economies) have increased energy consumption. The “traditional” energy efficiency policies are still very necessary, but are not sufficient for reaching the Paris Agreement target and the rapid reduction of the energy demand. Policies focusing on energy conservation and sufficiency principles complement efficiency policies, in particular those aiming at changing end-user consumer behaviour and lifestyle by imposing some limitation to the demand for energy services. The article first reviews the concept of energy savings compared to energy efficiency and introduce the concept of energy sufficiency. Then the article explores and discusses some existing and new policy instruments that can address energy conservation and sufficiency such as: personal carbon allowances; energy/carbon taxation; progressive appliance and vehicles standards, and progressive building codes. The article’s focus is mainly on individual end-users and on residential buildings. Finally, the article provides an ex-ante assessment of the policies analysed, including their limitations, and offers some policy recommendations, based on a combination of instruments.}

It is vital for its social, economic, cultural, and ecological benefits, demanding in-depth research for sustainable development. Despite its potential contribution to sustainable development, previous studies on bamboo have been geographically and methodically limited, lacking a comprehensive analysis of its contribution to sustainable livelihoods. This study, employing the PRISMA method for systematic reviews of 127 articles, investigates (1) the distribution and trends of livelihood-based bamboo research and identifies knowledge gaps, (2) bamboo's role in livelihood enhancement, (3) challenges and opportunities in its livelihood values, and (4) strategies to optimize bamboo's livelihood potential. Through this review, we identified most of the research limited to Asia, with limited studies in Africa and Latin America. Out of 1600 species, most of the studies focus on only 83 bamboo species, noting their multifaceted contributions across all livelihood capital types: natural, human, physical, social, and financial. Despite administrative and technical challenges that limit its value, bamboo provides diverse tangible benefits, economic opportunities, environmental improvements, international appeal, and strong sociocultural ties. We advocate for resilient bamboo-based livelihoods through cooperative, participatory, and sustainable management approaches that integrate research and indigenous knowledge to navigate challenges and leverage bamboo's extensive benefits.}

Synthesizing the relevant literature, this paper provides a critical reflection on the transition to a CE in China. Key factors for China's success in shifting towards a CE are seen in multi-level indicators and upscaling niches. This paper makes a novel contribution on limitations to progress, based on emerging evidence on CE projects that fail to sustain. Enriched by experts feedback, this paper critically addresses future challenges to a deep transition resulting from implementation gaps between early majorities and mass markets and coordination challenges arising through regional and sectoral differences. In light of China's commitments to climate neutrality by 2060, such challenges are considered serious. Based on feasible policy learning, the paper however proposes synergies between the CE and decarbonisation driven by efficiency improvements, comprehensive core indicators, upscaling and urban policies as trigger for deeper transformations. Finally the paper undertakes broader reflections and an outlook on evidence-orientated policy learning for a CE and decarbonisation in China.}

Unpredictable precipitation patterns and droughts are contributing to declining crop productivity. Efforts to increase agricultural productivity include adoption of crops that are resistant to climate change and engaging in climate resilient agriculture. Currently, CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - associated protein) technology is being used in crop breeding practices to improve traits such as drought tolerance, nutrition and disease resistance. The aim of this review is to explore the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in developing climate resilient crops for mitigation of food insecurity and hunger and the attendant implications for small holder farmers in Africa. A comprehensive systematic search of peer reviewed articles in three bibliographic databases, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify documents relevant to applications and implications of CRISPR-mediated genome editing in crop improvement in the African context. The literature shows that CRISPR-Cas technology has been harnessed to enhance the resilience and nutritional content of various crops, by combatting biotic and abiotic stresses. The adoption of CRISPR-assisted crop improvement in breeding strategies can help smallholder farmers in low-middle income countries of Africa to adapt to climate change without productivity loss. By harnessing this technology, smallholder farmers can benefit from growing climate resilient crops with improved yields and stress resistance thereby contributing to food security and sustainable agriculture on the continent.}

They have opened the horizon for a vast array of applications and paved the way for a diversity of innovative solutions. Integrating drones with the Internet has led to the emergence of a new paradigm named the Internet of Drones (IoD). Several works dealt with the security of the IoD, and various surveys have been published on this topic over the past few years. The existing surveys either have limited scope or offer partial coverage of cybersecurity countermeasures. To address these gaps, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey related to the cyber and physical security of IoD. Differently from many surveys that only provide a classification of attacks/threats, we also propose three taxonomies that are related to (1) the assets of drones, (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures. The first taxonomy is a two-level classification of the assets in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to the IoD's tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. Based on the asset classification, we propose a taxonomy of attacks targeting the coarse and fine-grained assets, which allows a finer level of granularity to identify threats, and thus ensure better security. Also, we evaluate the risk of cyber and physical attacks by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of Impact, which connects four types of impacts, namely, Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment. We propose a taxonomy of technical and non-technical countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident, and Post-incident (or recovery). The pre-incident countermeasures are further classified as: preventive and detective. In addition, we present the countermeasures along with their performance and limitations. Finally, open research challenges are identified and ranked according to the level of attention they should receive from the research community. Also, future research directions and suggestions are presented for the security of the IoD.}

In fact, in most cases, users are not aware that their information is being gathered, nor can they properly control these data flows. Nowadays, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation calls for the adoption of transparent practices comprising, inter alia, adequate notification mechanisms, proper consent management schemes, and the development of models to empower the user as an active participant, with full control over the data flows, along with privacy preservation techniques.

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published on this topic from January 2000 to May 2020. Articles were reviewed and classified to identify the Guatemalan study location, type, topic, and data sources. Only a limited number of studies explored the interconnectedness of FEW systems; 26% of articles (36 out of 138) focused on two aspects of the FEW nexus, while 20% (27 out of 138) focused on all three aspects. Water issues were the most commonly studied, with drinking water, hydroelectricity, and wastewater management being frequently discussed. We also identified a low rate of primary data generation, with only 42% articles (58 of 138) generating new data, and greater emphasis of nexus research in the grey literature. The Guatemalan FEW connections revolve primarily around three separate yet related spheres: clean water and sanitation, climate change and renewable energy, and urbanization and modernization.

This study adopts the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and their sustainable targets as means to assess the intensity of the link between the PPP literature and sustainability. Findings show that the thematic keywords in the PPP literature are multidimensionally related to sustainability through 16 out of the 17 SDGs. However, the intensity of this relationship is heterogenous: while eleven SDGs were related to less than 5% of the topics, only four SDGs (i.e., 8, 9, 16, and 17) demonstrated a strong relationship with PPPs, representing 51 out of the 169 sustainability targets. Moreover, 19 sustainability targets within these four SDGs were found to be the most representative according to their connection with the studied PPP topics, underlining high interdependencies between the PPP field and the three sustainability dimensions (society, environment, and economy). Overall, this study establishes a foundation for future studies on sustainability in PPPs by proposing three research avenues associated with social, environmental, and economic perspectives: (1) exposing the life-cycle relations between sources of payment, financing conditions, and costs of PPPs. (2) examining the most relevant challenges in achieving social legitimacy of PPP programs in developing countries. (3) providing a multidimensional empirical analysis of the effectiveness of environmental assessment tools for PPP projects.}

Because the demand-side management can be a great ally in overcoming such challenges, the present study seeks to assist in these new challenges by conducting a literature review, accompanied by a critical analysis of Brazilian experiences with demand-side management actions such as daylight saving time, energy efficiency programs, time-of-use tariffs, distributed micro and mini generation, tariff flags, pilot demand response programs, voluntary demand reduction programs, structural demand response programs, and hourly electricity prices. In addition, the current regulatory framework of the Brazilian electricity sector in the context of the energy transition is presented and discussed. The results of this study clearly indicate that Brazil has made important and necessary recent advances in updating its regulatory framework in line with the energy transition process. Undoubtedly, such efforts will elevate demand-side management to an increasingly strategic level in the planning and operation of the country's electrical networks. However, it was found that route corrections must be made aimed at the adequate integration of distributed energy resources, especially regarding the need to improve the tariff schemes applied to the low-voltage consumers. Experimental projects related to the application of new tariffs, which were recently approved by the electricity sector regulator, are promising.}

With a focus on scenarios and emerging response options by affected sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, we found that the drivers of SOEs in SEA are both indirect and direct and have confounding impacts. Only a few researches used scenarios and models for assessing SOEs in SEA, a majority of which use Representative Concentration Pathways and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The impacts of SOEs range from environmental, ecological, economic, and social factors and require integrated response options including mitigation or adaptation that pay attention to the complexity of the intersection between human and natural systems.}

The operator is in the middle of this complexity, trying to understand the situation and make effective real-time decisions. Hence, human factors, especially cognitive ones, are a major issue to be addressed. The human cognitive part must be framed together with intelligent artefacts, requiring a systematic approach in the domain of joint cognitive systems. New software development methods in the form of assistants and wizards are necessary to help operators to be context-aware and reduce their technical workload regarding coding or computer-oriented skills, focusing on the task or service at hand. Building on previous research on the role of the human worker in an AIoT environment, this article analyses the described situation in terms of human cyber–physical systems, with the aim of proposing a conceptual framework for these assistance systems at the cognitive level.

This manuscript reviews the relevant literature on microfinance to unveil how organizational form relates to the funding sources (resource acquisition) and the performance metrics in these institutions. We propose a simple framework that identifies two (2) main groups of MFIs based on their foundational logic, defining them as socially-oriented and commercially-oriented MFIs. For each group, the dominant organizational form is described in the context of its capital structure and performance metrics, and based on these findings, insights are offered to address practical issues in the resource acquisition of social enterprises serving the BOP in emerging markets.}

The sustainability of airport operations is being raised in various international platforms. This paper aims to identify the dimensions of sustainability and evaluate sustainable practices in airports of selected ASEAN countries. The various dimensions associated with the environmental aspect are energy management, emissions management, water and effluents management, solid waste management. It was understood that noise management, employee development, and community investment belong to the social dimension. Similarly, the factors such as economic contribution, passenger experience, airport safety, and security are inclined to economic dimensions of sustainability. It was found that environmentally sustainable practices have greater importance than social and economic initiatives in the airport context which provide quantifiable benefits for airports in the long term. Airport operators in South East Asia strived to mitigate carbon emissions, reduce waste and effluents, enhance the economic contribution, satisfy passengers, and meet employee needs. Compared to the total economic and social benefits obtained from these airports, the negative impacts of airport operation (such as noise emission from aircraft) are minimal but significant. The most common sustainable initiatives in airports, such as employee development, energy management, and passenger safety, supported sustainable development goals (SDG) 8, SDG 9, and SDG 11. A weak connection is observed between SDG 14 & SDG 15 and the airport's sustainable practices. The new technological innovations are concentrated in busy and profitable airports. A slow trend towards the adoption of new technologies for sustainable practices is observed in airports. The paper concludes that major airport operators in South-East Asia have effectively responded to the growing sustainability challenges in aviation markets. The sustainable dimensions and practices discussed will be valuable resource for airports striving to achieve sustainability goals.}

Specifically, it analyzes the research progress in detecting and diagnosing surface and internal road distress and related techniques and algorithms are compared. In addition, also introduces various road governance technologies, including automated repairs, intelligent construction, and path planning for crack sealing. Despite their proven effectiveness in detecting road distress, analyzing diagnoses, and planning maintenance, these technologies still confront challenges in data collection, parameter optimization, model portability, system accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance. Consequently, the integration of multidisciplinary technologies is imperative to enable the development of an integrated approach that includes road detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This paper addresses the challenges of precise defect detection, condition assessment, and unmanned construction. At the same time, the efficiency of labor liberation and road maintenance is achieved, and the automation level of the road engineering industry is improved.}

To make explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) systems trustworthy, understanding harmful effects is important. In this paper, we address an important yet unarticulated type of negative effect in XAI. We introduce explainability pitfalls (EPs), unanticipated negative downstream effects from AI explanations manifesting even when there is no intention to manipulate users. EPs are different from dark patterns, which are intentionally deceptive practices. We articulate the concept of EPs by demarcating it from dark patterns and highlighting the challenges arising from uncertainties around pitfalls. We situate and operationalize the concept using a case study that showcases how, despite best intentions, unsuspecting negative effects, such as unwarranted trust in numerical explanations, can emerge. We propose proactive and preventative strategies to address EPs at three interconnected levels: research, design, and organizational. We discuss design and societal implications around reframing AI adoption, recalibrating stakeholder empowerment, and resisting the “move fast and break things” mindset.}

We argue that beyond their individual contributions to supporting urban resilience, the interactions across the various dimensions are key to enhancing resilience. Ultimately, participatory processes are needed to assess resilience originating from GI systems and avoid injustice.}

The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol addresses some of the challenges of managing GHG emissions associated with refrigerant gases – aiming for countries to reduce them by 85% by 2047 (from a 2019 baseline for developed countries). This paper presents the first holistic framework for transitioning cooling towards circularity, with an emphasis on the global production network of cooling. It serves to analyse active technologies (including but not limited to air conditioners) to inform such a transition. This circular cooling production network framework is based on an extensive and systematic literature review including text-mining algorithms to analyse word correlations and detect topics. The application of the framework reveals the long-term interactions between cooling macro-drivers and the various stages of the cooling lifecycle. For example, currently the energy used by cooling technologies dominates their carbon footprint reporting but shifting to cleaner energy supply solutions will make components' production and end-of-life stages more important for circularity. Working proactively to address, and not only some, but all stages of the production network is thereby critical. Three cooling energy-intensive cases are used to describe the analysis: cold chains, commercial refrigeration, and air conditioning in buildings. Specific intervention points are examined for each which can improve the circularity of the production network, for instance, using passive measures to reduce the need for active cooling, recycling appliances, and raising awareness to improve users' behaviour. As the expanding global requirements of cooling unfold, this paper lays forth pathways to influence its growth as a system in alignment with achieving a circular economy.}

Their light-to-color conversion is highly dependent on the electronic band structure and charge transfer, and they obey the mechanism of electron accumulation in semiconductors when excited within the bandgap. Pure semiconductors face limitations in practical applications due to insufficient light absorption, charge carrier recombination, and low charge capacity. Diverse forms of photochromic hybrids (nanopowders, films, hydrogels, and multilayer structures) with rapid change, repeatability, and reversibility are possible via nanocustomization, surface/interface engineering, heterojunction fabrication, and complexing organic ligands. Manipulating the function of photochromic systems through light stimulation is becoming an attractive paradigm, divided into two branches: light-color complementarity and photoconductivity. This review examines the widely accepted photoresponsive principles and the still controversial energy transfer models. We emphasize the correlation between material properties and performance enhancement to inspire the rational structure design. The bottlenecks in current development are identified by analyzing application-specific innovation concepts, fabrication processes, and performance metrics. In addition, we present several perspectives to encourage meaningful multidisciplinary collaboration.}

To explore these issues in depth, we show how they arise frequently in UK energy policy research and its impact on policymaking. First, our systematic review shows how researchers present patchy or inconsistent stories, in which the role of policy and policymaking is unclear, when they describe energy systems. Second, UK and devolved governments often use the language of systems to propose paradigmatic energy policy change, but refer to a metaphor rather than academic insights. Third, we outline three ways to make clearer sense of energy transitions and policy with reference to socio-technical, complex, and social-ecological systems.}

These problems are prompting urban areas to chart novel path towards adopting sustainable production/consumption strategies. The alluring concept of circular economy (CE) that focuses on reuse and recycling of materials in technical and biological cycles to reduce waste generation is a critical intervention. Present article aims on precisely highlighting the importance of biogenic materials which have an immense potential to be transformed into a source of value in an urban ecosystem. It also sets out to explore the scope of implementing ‘urban biocycles’ that strategically directs the flow of resources, their use, extracting value in the form of nutrients, energy and materials post consumption within an urban metabolic regime. The concepts discussed contribute to biocycle economy by outlining emerging requirements, identification of common strategies, policies and emerging areas of research in line with sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {This systematic review provides an overview of the various perspectives that investigate alternative trade arrangements in the global food sector. With child labor in cocoa production, health issues of plantation workers in the global south and unsustainable consumption patterns of consumers in the global north, trade arrangements in the global food sector remain on largely unsustainable pathways with vast consequences for a sustainable development. Alternative Trade arrangements have been proposed as one way to tackle the above-mentioned issues and have been increasingly investigated through the scientific literature. However, evidence about the impact of alternative trade arrangements on consumption in the global north or production in the global south is disputed. While there have been efforts to review the scientific literature, existing reviews have focused only on specific aspects (e.g. consumer perception or effectiveness of producer certification schemes). We therefore systematically reviewed 649 peer-reviewed publications that investigated food products and alternative trade arrangements to create a more comprehensive overview of the strand of literature, its epistemic similarities and differences. We found that the scientific literature is predominantly investigating the certified market, focusing on certification schemes and its implementations. Furthermore, we show that the literature is either focusing on producers or consumers and has a strong bias towards social aspects of sustainability. Using a quantitative word-based analysis, we identified three substantially different clusters: first, producer impact assessment, dominated by econometrics; second, contextual producer perspectives, emphasizing the political and social sphere through qualitative single case study analyses; and third consumers' attitudes and willingness to pay for ethical products, characterized by psychological and econometric measures. Based on our findings we propose three future directions for research in the field of alternative trade. First, scholars should put a stronger emphasis on going beyond the impact assessment of certification schemes and examine underlying aspects such as information asymmetries, smallholder empowerment and ethical consumption behavior. Second, interconnections between social and ecological factors needs further investigation as both factors have a strong influence on each other. Third, scholars should put a stronger focus on participatory approaches to gain a deeper understanding of root causes of unjust trade arrangements and enhance mutual understanding of scientific perceptions and realworld practices.}

Background and aims
Artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded applications in both medicine and biomedical sciences, focusing on medical diagnosis, risk prediction of disease onset, support of therapeutic techniques, and other subjects. In parallel, several applications in nutrition have been developed, such as microbiota/genes-diet interactions, investigation of diet-disease relationships, chatbots for lifestyle intervention, dietary assessment with food photographs, and food composition applications.
Methods
The positive aspects and ethical concerns were analyzed regarding the use of AI in nutrition.
Results
In general, AI should do no harm and contribute to human well-being, while AI professionals should be honest, trustful, and fair. Privacy and confidentiality should be protected. Other concerns include the “dehumanization” of care, social disparities, responsibility assignment in case of errors or malfunctions, and bias in training models and delivering care. Moreover, the prediction of disease onset in high-risk individuals may be connected to stigma, over-medicalization, and stress. There is also a serious concern that AI systems in the field of nutrition and dietetics may cause a partial replacement of dietitians; however, health professionals can use such technologies as part of their work. The use of AI applications for persons with mental diseases or eating disorders is also crucial.
Conclusion
In conclusion, AI-assisted personalized nutrition needs further justification, while the regulatory framework requires a constant update to keep up with scientific advancements and address ethical issues. Coordinated global focus on these domains could effectively lead to a more embraced AI implementation in individuals and populations.}

Servitization literature combines different research streams that share a set of critical concepts. Existing meta-analytical studies have organized information content of sub-streams, homogenized theoretical propositions, and concepts to discover shared patterns, and identified an implicit meta-narrative. This study reverses the meta-analysis direction to deconstruct the servitization body of knowledge using the dynamic topic modeling (DTM) methodology to analyze 550 research articles. DTM enables complex forms of content analysis that combine quantitative and qualitative analysis. The analysis demonstrates how these streams have informed the development of the servitization domain and shaped the collective construction of this body of knowledge. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, the study increases understanding of the conceptual dynamics and thematic trends within the servitization research domain and the nuances between the sub-streams. The study offers some strategies for the future development of the field, facilitating the renewal of the servitization-related research agenda. Second, it illustrates the role of DTM as an alternative tool for conducting a literature review. Finally, it supports the development of a common language for the servitization field, thereby reducing the entry barriers for new contributors and favoring the knowledge transfer to professionals.}

Humans are tool-making creatures and AI is used for civilization via tools. During the time of pre-civilization, tools were simple in the form of crude construction, using hand skills but at present, the achievements are the substitution of machinery to relieve/replace human intellect. AI is the scientific technique of bringing learning, adaptation, and self-organization of machines. It encompasses various concepts and methods, deployed by researchers in many diverse fields of computation and cognition. This is the computational mode of a brain, based on artificial neural networks. The usefulness of AI ethically, initiates a big question i.e. if the human mind is not self-sufficient for any work without harming the moral sentiment of others then, how can people believe in a computational model of the mind, is a machine, morally responsible for any good or bad action. We highlight issues on the use of AI in the replacement of the human mind asking what is the value of humans in this age of AI? Can AI reciprocate and respect human values better than human beings? Can AI replace human intelligence? In the case of ethical enquiry, it is rather a herculean task to consider a machine's action to be moral or immoral, after all, it is just a machinery action devoid of any moral quality.}

In biomedical research, big data imply also a big responsibility. This is not only due to genomics data being sensitive information but also due to genomics data being shared and re-analysed among the scientific community. This saves valuable resources and can even help to find new insights in silico. To fully use these opportunities, detailed and correct metadata are imperative. This includes not only the availability of metadata but also their correctness. Metadata integrity serves as a fundamental determinant of research credibility, supporting the reliability and reproducibility of data-driven findings. Ensuring metadata availability, curation, and accuracy are therefore essential for bioinformatic research. Not only must metadata be readily available, but they must also be meticulously curated and ideally error-free. Motivated by an accidental discovery of a critical metadata error in patient data published in two high-impact journals, we aim to raise awareness for the need of correct, complete, and curated metadata. We describe how the metadata error was found, addressed, and present examples for metadata-related challenges in omics research, along with supporting measures, including tools for checking metadata and software to facilitate various steps from data analysis to published research.}

Pioneering countries utilize green infrastructural applications to improve their resilience against climate change by adopting adaptive solutions and mitigating pollution sources. This paper includes an overview of the implementation of green infrastructure exemplified by bioretention in urban development and ecosystem maintenance. The good engineering practice for bioretention was established by applying data collected from other research. Biomantle and semi-direct injection of storm water are the two methods for sustaining bioretention functionalities for peak flow reduction and soil stability enhancement. Maximum pollutants reduction efficiencies by bioretention were reported in the past research, including 99% of phosphorus, 82% of nitrate, 92% of heavy metals, and 96% of suspended solid. Lastly, a conclusive benefit analysis of green infrastructure from environmental, economic, and social perspectives was conducted.}

Energy systems integration connecting the power, gas, heat and transport systems, is one possible pathway to drive the transition flexibly and cost-effectively. Nevertheless, more quantified evidence on the performance of future integrated energy systems towards achieving policy objectives is still needed for decision makers to support this route. This paper first identifies the expected changes to the energy system upon integration, including new interactions and interdependencies between its components and actors. The paper then argues the need for a whole energy systems approach for the evaluation of integrated energy systems, represented by six characteristics: multidimensional, multivectoral, systemic, futuristic, systematic, and applicability. Based on the identified characteristics, the paper reviews existing evaluation frameworks for energy systems sustainability, and qualitatively appraises their adequacy for evaluating future integrated energy systems. The review concludes that existing frameworks are not capable of assessing the performance of integrated energy systems, lacking one or more of the characteristics. The paper finally presents a novel holistic evaluation framework based on the System-of-Systems approach for systems analysis coupled with an indicator-based approach for evaluation. The proposed framework demonstrates the six characteristics as it enables evaluation with respect to multiple perspectives and objectives at different system levels. Moreover, this framework captures future changes to the whole energy system architecture and highlights the interdependencies between energy systems. This framework can also be systematically applied to various scenarios in different contexts.}

In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking, monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption, interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles for the wider use of IoT in CBM.}

A review of recent progress in biology and digital sciences suggests that such strategies might be universal: many living and technological systems favor the interests of the population to the detriment of individuals, at all scales. They behave in a suboptimal manner, restraining short-term performances while ensuring a high level of global resilience. This paper describes the features of such suboptimal systems. By synthesizing numerous examples within biological, and socio-cultural systems, we show how suboptimality might constitute a powerful source of inspiration to address the numerous trade-offs humanity is facing in the anthropocene. Should human societies curb their performance for the now anthropic ecosystems to be resilient? New research themes, such as soft law, agroecology, and planetary health, already echo suboptimal behaviors. These examples suggest that a better knowledge of suboptimal systems could help formalize a rational limit to human development towards sustainability, very much like the planetary boundaries for their Earth counterpart. Conversely, this synthesis also raises a question of whether human societies could be resilient without being suboptimal?}

The COVID-19 outbreak has profound ramifications for multiple dimensions of landscapes, ranging from mobility and lifestyle to value to environment and society. Therefore, integrated approaches to “health” have been more vigorously promoted in the policy arena dealing with human–nature interactions. The ecosystem principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which resonate with landscape approaches, are generally aligned with integrated approaches to health. However, commonalities and distinctions between these integrated approaches in both political and scientific domains have not been clarified. Drawing on a narrative review of the literature on “One Health,” “Ecohealth,” and “Planetary Health” as major health-oriented approaches in comparison with landscape approaches, the aspects of landscape approaches to be complemented in addressing health-related challenges were examined in this study. In addition to the review on the intellectual roots and evolutionary pathways, a comparative analysis of these relevant approaches was conducted in terms of three realms including theoretical assumptions, knowledge bases, and research paradigms. The results of the comparative review show that all approaches share systems thinking, interdisciplinarity, cross-sectoral collaboration, and holistic paradigm but differ with respect to their focused management problems, disciplines, and sectors as well as ontological and epistemological underpinnings. Pointing to the recent theoretical and methodological development in integrating health in placemaking, the results of this study suggest that pragmatic landscape approaches could be strengthened by using health-related research paradigms to achieve better constructivism–positivism meeting grounds regarding health–landscape intersections.}

keywords = {Nile, Waterways, Water conservation, Awareness campaigns, Landscape architecture},
abstract = {The Nile River is the primary water source for populous and hyper-arid Egypt. However, it suffers from the backfilling of its extensive network of waterways and increasing encroachments along its banks. The Nile’s waterways are among the world’s oldest and largest water irrigation systems. As an integral component of the Nile water system, they are vital in sustaining agriculture, inhabitants’ quality of life in urban and rural settings, and various ecosystem services. Therefore, raising public awareness and a sense of connectivity with the conservation of these waterways is one of the primary mitigation strategies for addressing the dire water deficit in Egypt resulting from rapid population growth and flow alteration associated with increased upstream damming. The large-scale degradation of the waterways system, observed since the mid-1980s, is perplexing, as Egyptians were historically more oriented to preserving the Nile ecosystem and the interrelated landscape for thousands of years. To assess the root cause of this phenomenon, we review the waterways’ public conservation campaigns and explore the grounds for their inefficiencies, failures, and subsequent impacts on transboundary water management. To achieve this objective, we compiled several research publications, local technical reports, and ground observations. Our results show that negligence toward the waterways accelerated during the nation’s transition from water sufficiency in the 1970s (1400 m3/capita/year) to the onset of scarcity in the 1980s (<1000 m3/capita/year). The water authorities’ delay of 15 years in implementing conservation campaigns, which were unhurriedly initiated in the mid-1990s, along with unsustainable landscape transformations, led to nationwide water misuse and sanitary degradation of the Nile’s infrastructure. Considering the findings of our review, we provide recommendations for improving the efficiency of waterways conservation campaigns. Our findings could be applied to other Nile riparian nations with similar environmental and socioeconomic settings.}

Food security and agricultural sustainability are essential for an equitable and healthy society. Increasing food demand, growing inequalities, climate change and pandemics are converging to undermine food security. These factors are contributing to an impending global food crisis, with 30% of people worldwide lacking regular access to adequate food. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to address techno-economic challenges in the agro-food sector by improving food production, quality, supply chain management and commerce. The innovations offered by digitalization in agricultural and food systems can help attain the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals. Here, we review the importance and application of digitalization in the agriculture and food sectors. The modernization of agriculture through technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, precision farming, and big data analytics has been emphasized. The integration of these techniques would significantly increase yield with minimal human interference, leading to environmental, social and economic sustainability. The adoption of digital technologies in agriculture allows for at least a 23% reduction in costs and a nearly 5% decrease in the volume of medium-level waste. Furthermore, digitalization in food safety and electronic commerce is increasingly being adopted. Future trends lie in blockchain technology for improving traceability and personalized foods catering to individual consumer needs for better health and nutrition.}

With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.}

Critical materials are resources that are vulnerable to supply disruptions, where those disruptions can have significant adverse impacts on society. In the coming years, materials supply risks associated with the energy transition and geopolitics are likely to intensify and new risks are expected to emerge. This perspective identifies three “Grand Challenges” that represent frontier areas for critical materials research and highlights some promising new directions for each area: (1) extending visibility downstream to value-added materials beyond elemental forms; (2) quantifying the risks associated with market dynamics; and (3) developing tools to inform policy interventions. Emerging digital capabilities have the potential to play a significant role addressing long-standing limitations in data quality and access to unlock progress on these challenges. Progress in these areas can equip decision-makers across industry, government, and finance with tools to understand the complexity and uncertainty introduced by these real-world challenges.}

To truly achieve sustainability, cities need to ensure that their consumption is compatible with absolute sustainability and validate achievements from a perspective that includes transboundary impacts. The aim of this review is to assess how well these topics are incorporated into commonly used urban sustainability assessment methods, using the safe and just space (SJS) framework definition of a minimum acceptable threshold for both ecological stability and standard of living. The review identified 277 different sustainability indicator frameworks that have been applied to cities and undertook a detailed assessment of the most commonly cited of these. Consumption-based footprint studies were separately assessed to determine the extent to which they measure SJS indicators for cities. Both indicator frameworks and footprint studies had a focus on boundaries of increasing risk, including carbon, water, and land use; however few measured highly exceeded boundaries including nitrogen and phosphorus use, biodiversity, and possibly chemical pollution. Social impacts were well covered in indicator frameworks, except food intake, but largely absent from footprint studies. Cities are largely not measuring their impact on planetary tipping points or transboundary impacts, risking resolving some environmental issues while exacerbating others.}

Having a sound understanding of the existing barriers and challenges to community inclusive decision-making process is paramount for finding solutions for transforming current practices towards equitable urban development. Accordingly, this comprehensive, structured literature review aims to consolidate literature of the current challenges and barriers to community-driven decision-making in urban development and of the potential solutions to overcome them. A structured literature review covering indexed publications from 2010 to 2020 was carried out to identify and classify barriers/challenges and solutions that exist at present. Following a systematic filtering process, a total of 63 out of 1324 research contributions have been considered for an in-depth analysis. The study found 48 barriers and challenges regarding the current context, available infrastructure for community engagement, and current decision-making processes. Of all, the lack of communities’ knowledge and awareness, absence of meaningful community engagement, and ill-defined aims and purpose of community engagement were identified as the topmost constraints. By synthesising the current research, the study found that these barriers can potentially be overcome through attitude transformation and capacity building of both community and professionals, investment in community engagement, and changes to present stakeholder engagement processes and policies.}

CCUS was therefore proposed as a technological decarbonization strategy to prevent millions of tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 from entering and remaining in the atmosphere. In this review, the necessity and suitability of offshore CCUS in China are explored, involving examining the potential for sedimentary basins offshore China to act as carbon sinks for industrialized coastal regions and investigating the opportunities of developing a commercial full value chain. In China, the CO2 emissions from the 14 coastal provincial administrative regions are estimated to be over 4.2 Gt, occupying ∼41% of the country’s carbon emissions, whereas the storage capacity of the sedimentary basins offshore China is estimated to be 573–779 GtCO2. This could total 140–190 years of emissions from China’s coastal regions, which also avoids complex legal regulation and public opposition. However, economic costs pose substantial challenges to deploying offshore CCUS on a commercial scale, which requires significant technological innovations, national contributions, and business investments, particularly in the eastern and southeastern regions.}

It is recognised as the latest attempt to balance industrial development, environmental health, and economic growth. Although academic literature in this field has been gradually developing, it is limited in its analysis in terms of economic and competitive opportunity in the face of different strategies. This article provides a holistic view by mapping the literature on strategies-based EC for the economic competitiveness of companies through a systematic literature review supported on the co-citation bibliometric technique. To this end, 126 articles were selected and organised into 5 clusters: (i) strategic applications of CE; (ii) mediating factors for implementing CE strategies; (iii) drivers of CE strategies; (iv) determinants used to promote CE; and (v) emerging digital technologies used to enable CE practices. The results of this study help practitioners assess EC from a new point of view and design competitive strategies for a circular model without neglecting economic growth and competitive advantage, in addition to serving as crucial evidence for policymakers, helping them leverage policies to circumvent sustainability concerns and promote circularity. A future agenda for detailed cluster-based research is put forward based on the identified gaps, including a framework to help managers set priorities to escape the zero-profit trend associated with green and sustainable practices.}

From a Digital Forensics (DF) point of view, this connection turns an IoT environment into a valuable source of evidence containing diverse artifacts that could significantly aid DF investigations. Therefore, DF must adapt to the characteristics of IoT Forensics (IoTF). With the increasing deployment of IoT, organizations are compelled to revise their approaches to planning, developing, and implementing Information Technology (IT) security strategies. The IoT presents new business opportunities but also simultaneously creates various challenges related to cyber-attacks and their resolution. For optimal preparedness in the face of future incidents, companies should consider implementing Forensics Readiness (FR). This paper thus examines the factors that influence IoT-FR within organizations. By systematically analyzing research efforts from 2010 to 2023, we identified the following factors influencing IoT-FR: (1) Legal Aspect, (2) Standardization Approach, (3) Technological Resource and Technique, (4) Management Process and (5) Human Factor. Furthermore, these influencing factors are not only considered individually but also in terms of the dependencies between them. This results in the creation of a holistic model including the interdependencies and influences of the factors to provide a novel overview and enhance the integrated perspective on IoT-FR. The knowledge of factors influencing the integration of IoT-FR into organizations is valuable. It thus can be of enormous importance, as it can save time and money in the event of a subsequent incident. Additionally, alongside these factors, various challenges, techniques, models, and frameworks are highlighted to offer profound insights into the relatively novel subject of IoT-FR and to inspire future research.}

The established concept of Food Security is well defined and researched, whereas the emerging concept of Soil Security is building its currency globally. Addressing Soil Security provides the means to improve food, fibre and water quality in a sustainable manner, through enhanced soil care and development of best land-management practices. Soil is a fragile resource which is degraded in many parts of the world. The rapidly growing global population has placed further pressure on the soil resource to accommodate increased demand for food, fibre and soil-derived materials. Such pressures are accelerating degradation and so novel approaches are needed. Literature search within this review demonstrated Soil Security and Food Security to be a convergence of disciplines. To truly identify solutions to challenges faced in either realm, an interdisciplinary approach seeking to understand deeper interactions between the two concepts is needed. Driven by this need, our review sought to investigate such interactions between the challenges faced in Soil Security and Food Security. Following assessment of these interactions, four potential solutions were discussed and included sustainable intensification and management, digital agriculture, circularisation and reducing the food demand trajectory through enhanced soil care. Soil Security and Food Security are interconnected concepts which will help facilitate implementation of the above solutions, and so approaches are needed which take this connection into account.}

However, the nature of this relationship is quite complex, overlapped, interconnected, and diverse. Therefore, this paper conducted a systematic review of the literature on university-city and campus-city relationships to evaluate recent research trends to uncover the aspects that connect universities with their respective cities. The search included articles published in 4 different databases from January 1990 to January 2021. A total number of 50 articles were selected in this review. The findings uncovered different aspects that could help or hinder university-city relationship based on the physical and functional linkage between the campus and the city. Moreover, findings have shown that it is necessary to understand universities according to their contextual differences, as universities have shown different impacts on their respective cities in terms of their sizes and locations. Results have also shown that the impact of the physical connection between the university and the city goes far beyond campus’s accessibility as it deeply affects students’ social life as well. Therefore, decision makers, stakeholders, and university administrators need to co-design campus development process especially in the early stages to maximize the mutual benefits of campus-city relationship. The main conclusions of this paper address several perspectives and lessons for a more sustainable campus-city relationship.}

abstract = {A deeper decarbonization perspective is undergoing with the increasing engagement of new distributed players and the deployment of innovative behind-the-meter flexibility services. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading has emerged as an innovative mechanism to foster the direct energy sharing among multi-level market players with pre-determined responsibility and privacy. However, compared with other P2P assets trading, P2P energy trading is facing huge challenges in achieving a large-scale commercialization due to the cooperation obstacles between non-professional distributed players and regulated players as Distributed System Operator (DSO), Transmission System Operator (TSO) and utilities. It is related to not only business and marketing, but also energy system operation to keep secure and reliable with injection of new roles, new utilization patterns, and new markets. This paper investigates the socio-technical interaction and mechanism for the sustainable P2P energy trading from the social dimension on the cooperation of multi-level market players, the technical dimension on the cutting-edge exchange of flexibility, and the economical dimension on the inter-operative decentralized/regulated marketplaces. Three questions are targeted on: (1) How Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enables co-creation of decentralized heterogeneous user-centered digital frameworks for the large-scale P2P trading interaction, (2) What specific energy services drive the cross-border interactions for exchange of multi-scale P2P flexibility, (3) How operational framework in P2P energy trading achieves the inter-operative marketplaces with the formation of trusted P2P energy society and the injection of multi-scale flexibility services. Finally, regulation challenges on P2P energy trading implementation are discussed for the guide of future work.}

abstract = {As a major solution to climate change, the low-carbon transition of energy systems has received growing attention in the past decade. This paper presents a bibliometric review of the literature on the low-carbon transition of energy systems from an engineering management perspective. First, the definition and boundaries of the energy system transition are clarified, covering transformation of the energy structure, decarbonization of fossil fuel utilization, and improvement in energy efficiency. Second, a systematic search of the related literature and a bibliometric analysis are conducted to reveal the research trends. It is found that the number of related publications has been growing exponentially during the past decade, with researchers from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands comprising the majority of authors. Related studies with interdisciplinary characteristics appear in journals focusing on energy engineering, environmental science, and social science related to energy issues. Four major research themes are identified by clustering the existing literature: ① low-carbon transition pathways with different spatiotemporal scales and transition constraints; ② low-carbon technology diffusion with a focus on renewable energy technologies, pollution control technologies, and other technologies facilitating the energy transition; ③ infrastructure network planning for energy systems covering various sectors and regions; and ④ transition-driving mechanisms from the political, economic, social, and natural perspectives. These four topics play distinct but mutually supportive roles in facilitating the low-carbon transition of energy systems, and require more in-depth research on designing resilient low-carbon transition pathways with coordinated goals, promoting low-carbon technologies with cost-effective and reliable infrastructure network deployment, and balancing multi-level risks in various systems. Finally, business models, nongovernment actors, energy justice, deep decarbonization, and zero-energy buildings are recognized as emerging hot topics.}

This topic has attracted growing academic interest in recent years. However, the evaluation of case studies regarding Circular Economy implementation, strategies, and practices (at all levels) is still in its infancy. With the aim of bridging this gap, this paper analyses, through a systematic review of case studies, the implementation of circular practices in all economic sectors and industries of the European Union (from 2015 until April 2023). To this end, this research uses a framework of circular strategies built considering the European Union political framework. Based on this analysis, it can be deduced that recycling was the most used circular strategy (24.2%) to reintegrate materials into the economic system and reduce the use of raw materials (18.9%), demonstrating the existence of virtuous circles in the European Union's economic sectors. The results show that the best performing industry, in terms of circular strategies, is Food and Beverage (17.92%), within the Agri-food economic sector. While the economic sector with the least number of circular strategies (7.86%) is Capital Equipment. This paper proposes several tools for Circular Economy implementation that could lead to future research and support business, policymakers, and the scientific community.}

Therefore, it is important to understand to what extent firms are using greenwashing to mislead their stakeholders in the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature regarding greenwashing in supply chain management (SCM) to shed light on the main thematic groups addressed in the literature, understand its challenges and develop a framework that highlights the key drivers that companies need to tackle to prevent greenwashing in supply chains. For this purpose, we have conducted a systematic literature review, following a three-stage method. It was possible to identify possible solutions to prevent greenwashing across four main dimensions of SCM: consumers/customers; relationships between focal firms and suppliers; certification programs and reporting assessment; and corporate leadership. We provide a framework to help firms develop their sustainable strategy and prevent greenwashing along the supply chain. This paper synthesizes the challenges that firms face when implementing a sustainable supply chain, suggests solutions to prevent greenwashing and provides future research avenues.}

Yet, how to precisely increase the spaces in which people experiencing marginalisation can address power asymmetries and strengthen their resilience, particularly from a methodological perspective, remains poorly understood. Here, we build on recent insights into political capabilities and their relevance for equitable resilience practice to assess the role research methods play in not only locating political capabilities but also enhancing them in the context of climate resilience. We present the findings from an in-depth analysis of 57 articles, out of a larger set of 200+ papers, that have employed co-learning/cooperative inquiries, participatory action research, participatory methods, workshops, and/or interviews combined with other approaches as most engaging and potentially empowering methods. Methodological insights through this analysis allow us to examine if and how resilience-in-the-making materialises across uneven power relations and often flawed decision-making processes. We show the pervasiveness of power differentials, even in research settings designed to be inclusive, and how disempowering processes in adaptation, mitigation, disaster management, and social transformation further marginalise already disadvantaged actors. At the same time, we illustrate the transformative role of alliances, resistance, shared learning, and sustaining inclusive approaches. Such nuanced insights into best processes as well as detrimental pitfalls are essential for development scholars and practitioners to help anchor deliberative resilience practice in the everyday lives of disadvantaged populations and foster political capabilities for more just climate action and policy.}

This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical progression, current research clusters, and emerging trends in UHV research by utilising a scientometric method. It examines 2340 UHV-related scholarly articles published over the past fifty years (1970s to 2020s). The major findings of this scientometric analysis are: (a) UHV is an emerging research area and is expected to rapidly expand; (b) UHV research is clustered around five interconnected key areas: Urban planning and architectural design; Urban environment and ecology; Urban public health and wellbeing; Urban climate and meteorology; Urban remote sensing; (c) The recent shift in research focus towards public health and wellbeing perspectives in UHV studies highlights the importance of a human-social focus and interdisciplinary collaboration; (d) Remote sensing, particularly supported by machine learning, is a significant technical tool in UHV research; (e) UHV research aligns with the UN sustainable development goals and contributes to achieving urban sustainability and climate resilience. Further advancements in UHV research will require interdisciplinary collaboration, technological innovations, and targeted policies to effectively address urban heat impacts and protect vulnerable populations.}

Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0.}

One solution is the development and mobilization of technologies that either 1)prevent plastics from entering waterways or2) collect marine and riverineplastic pollution. To date, however, few reports have focused on these technologies, and information on various technological developments is scattered. This leaves policymakers, innovators, and researchers without a central, comprehensive, and reliable source of information on the status of available technology to target this global problem. The goal of this study was to address this gap by creating a comprehensive inventory of technologies currently used or in development to prevent the leakage of plastic pollution or collect existing plastic pollution. Our Plastic Pollution Prevention and Collection Technology Inventory (https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/plastics-technology-inventory) can be used as a roadmap for researchers and governments to 1) facilitate comparisons between the scope of solutions and the breadth and severity of the plastic pollution problem and 2) assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses of current technological approaches. We created this inventory from a systematic search and review of resources that identified technologies. Technologies were organized by the type of technology and target plastics (i.e., macroplastics, microplastic, or both). We identified 52 technologies that fall into the two categories of prevention or collection of plastic pollution. Of these, 59% focus specifically on collecting macroplastic waste already in waterways. While these efforts to collect plastic pollution are laudable, their current capacity and widespread implementation are limited in comparison to their potential and the vast extent of the plastic pollution problem. Similarly, few technologies attempt to prevent plastic pollution leakage, and those that do are limited in scope. A comprehensive approach is needed that combines technology, policymaking, and advocacy to prevent further plastic pollution and the subsequent damage to aquatic ecosystems and human health.}

Building on this overview, the authors highlight the current research gap and propose potential pathways for future research to facilitate the diffusion of ECs. It was found that although ECs are studied context-specific, generic factors have contributed to the emergence of ECs independently from their location, such as appropriate policy schemes and support for practitioners. Factors, such as the geographies of the transition, and cognitive-cultural factors remain less studied.}
