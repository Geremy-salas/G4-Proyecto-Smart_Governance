abstract = {The digital age brings great promise for human development. Yet, the benefits of digital technology can only be realised by mobilising global cooperation to close persistent digital divides and address the harms, risks, and uncertainties of digitalisation. To date, the global digital landscape is dominated by private technology companies and a few governments of technologically advanced countries, while less developed countries and civil society actors effectively have no voice. The goal of the United Nations’s (UN) Digital Cooperation initiative is to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs of digital transformation while ensuring that no-one is left behind. The UN’s Digital Cooperation identifies the main directions for action but also acknowledges that persistent governance gaps undermine its cooperation efforts. This paper argues that we can learn how to improve global cooperation to govern the digital space by drawing on experiences from global environmental governance. Based on an extensive literature review, I show how existing governance gaps in global digital cooperation can be analysed and addressed. Specifically, I focus on the implications for the UN and identify which roles and functions it could take. Online misinformation is used as a compelling illustration of how lessons derived from environmental governance can inform responses to digital problems. The paper outlines an agenda that can set UN Digital Cooperation on a path towards success in mitigating the uncertainties the digital future will bring.}

abstract = {To reduce the energy consumption of buildings and limit their impact on the environment, greater attention has been paid, in recent years, to adaptive building envelopes technologies. Combining the dual function of sensors and actuators, smart materials are configured as excellent allies of adaptive technologies. Their responsiveness facilitates the dynamic interaction between the building and the environment through the building envelope configured as a living interface, similar to the skin of natural organisms. This study aims to explore the current trends and potential applications of smart materials to define biomimetic solutions for environmentally adaptive building envelopes. Starting from specifying the fine distinction between adaptive and responsive solutions, the PRISMA method is used to conduct a systematic literature review, together with a bibliometric analysis, to identify the main common occurrences of the keywords, the predominant geographical areas and the main sources. Only materials that respond to the environmental triggers of light, temperature and water were considered to create a design matrix that enriches the implementation phase of the biomimetic-Adaptive Model and provides researchers with a new useful tool for the biomimetic design phases. The study shows how smart materials can be used to realise the responsive functions of the biomimetic envelope, capable of regulating temperature, shielding solar radiation, filtering or reacting to variable environmental parameters. The application of smart materials in architecture is still limited, paving the way for future research discoveries and synergistic collaboration between architectural technologies, biology, and material sciences, and leading to a more sustainable built environment.}

We analyse connections between types of strategies through the lens of the Earth System Governance framework's original 5 A's – Architecture, Agency, Adaptiveness, Accountability, and Allocation & Access.

Critical findings are summarized for each part, i.e., the advances and trends in physical energy generation, transmission, consumption, and storage processes of cities for energy interventions, the cyber process chain of energy sensing, modeling, forecasting, scheduling, coordinating, and adapting for enhancing the “smartness” of power and urban energy systems, and the social energy processes of understanding, protecting, engaging, and governing human to be a new smartness dimension. Second, the process-based framework provides insights on the design and implementation of SG and SUES for engineers, planners, and policymakers, such as optimizing the system performance by upgrading individual processes and exploring new links among identified physical, cyber, and social energy processes. The upscaling barriers and strategies of sustainable energy technologies in the development and deployment stages are also summarized to scale up sustainable energy processes to a higher level. Finally, future research directions are envisioned, including developing data markets, privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics for urban-scale energy modeling, refining policy and standards for safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and interoperability issues, assessing technology maturity and energy system success factors, and removing regulatory and structural barriers.}

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential tools in the protection and conservation of marine ecosystems. However, very few MPAs are effective and meet their conservation objectives mainly due to a lack of coordination, participation or resources. For instance, in the Mediterranean Sea there are about 1062 MPAs, but 72% of them do not have effective regulations to reduce human impacts on biodiversity and current efforts are insufficient in managing human uses for the conservation and protection of marine biodiversity. This makes necessary to seek new ways or instruments for their management. In this sense, digitalization and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can provide tools to facilitate the development of MPAs management in a more effective, participatory and efficient manner because automatic agents report their information and digest the data no matter the situation. In the specific case of Spain, one of the main problems identified for MPAs management is the overlapping of different kinds of protected areas in the same territory. In addition, these are managed by different administrations (Regional, National). An example of this situation is the Sierra Helada Marine Natural Park (SHMP) in Alicante. Within its territorial scope there are 3 MPAs with different protection figures that overlap each other, SHMP, the Natura 2000 site of Serra Gelada i la Marina Baixa and a fishing protected area. These MPAs are managed by different regional governmental bodies, and have a natural resources action plan in use, supported by a management collaboration agreement with the town councils in the area and the Altea Nautical Club. In the SHMP, Posidonia oceanica (PO) is one of the most important ecosystems and its presence prompted its creation and declaration. PO is a marine angiosperm endemic to the Mediterranean Sea that forms extensive meadows from the sea surface to 30–40 m depth and which provides essential goods and services: it improves water quality and protect beaches against erosion. PO meadows are recognized as biodiversity hotspots, and as major carbon sinks, but they are very sensitive to human activities. However, although many regulations protect PO, there are still significant threats to their conservation. In this regard, the research presented in this paper is the development of an ICT-based software tool, called Smart MPA, that includes an analysis framework based on management and governance indicators specific for PO and a database on PO that includes and combines different sources of information, including the results obtained of the evaluation of the analytical framework, input from information from citizens or MPA users, for example, by sending photos to report infractions in PO at specific points and from satellite images or underwater UAVs. The main objective of the Smart MPA tool is to offer services applied to PO management, either through the analysis of governance indicators or by facilitating the integration of citizen information to be used in management activities. The tool has been tested and used by the management staff of SHMP to be applied to an annual monitoring of management measures to develop an adaptive management of PO and the SHMP. After that, a semi-structured interview was carried out to collect information on the analytical framework co-developed and a survey was created where management staff of SHMP have given their perception on the usability of the tool and on the environmental problems affecting the conservation of PO in SHMP. According to the results obtained, the management of PO in SHMP is efficient, at a general level, with the lack of adequate funding being a limiting factor. The main threats are boat anchoring and organic pollution. In conclusion, the Smart MPA tool and the analytical framework are instruments that can facilitate the management and promote good environmental governance processes for the conservation of PO meadows in SHMP. At the same time, the importance of exploring mobile apps to increase citizen participation and mitigate threats and impacts on PO have been highlighted.}

One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’.

This Special Issue therefore focuses on governance aspects, relating to and bridging business and political-institutional-societal levels. This includes social/societal factors, goals and implications that have recently been studied under the label of social innovation. Furthermore, the emergence of bioeconomy as a paradigm and policy goal has become a driver for a variety of innovation processes on company and institutional levels. Our article provides a tentative definition of “innovation governance” and attempts a state-of-art review of innovation governance research in the forest sector. For structuring the research field, we propose to distinguish between organizational/managerial, policy or innovation studies. For the forestry sector, specifically, we suggest to distinguish between studies focusing on (i) innovative governance of forest management and forest goods and services; on (ii) the governance of innovation processes as such, or (iii) on specific (transformational) approaches that may be derived from combined goals such as innovation governance for sustainability, regional development, or a bioeconomy. Studies in the forest sector are picking up new trends from innovation research that increasingly include the role of societal changes and various stakeholders such as civil society organizations and users. They also include public-private partnership models or participatory governance. We finally should not only look in how far research approaches from outside are applied in the sector but we believe that the sector could contribute much more to our general scientific knowledge on ways for a societal transformation to sustainability.}

Over the past two decades, global health diplomacy, foreign policy for health, and global health policy have changed substantially. Diplomacy is a constitutive part of the system of global health governance. COVID-19 hit the world when multilateral cooperation was subject to major challenges, and global health has since become integral to geopolitics. The importance of global health diplomacy, especially at WHO, in keeping countries jointly committed to improving health for everyone, has once again been shown. Through a systematic review, this Series paper explores how international relations concepts and theories have been applied to better understand the role of power in shaping positions, negotiations, and outcomes in global health diplomacy. We apply an international relations perspective to reflect on the effect that those concepts and theories have had on global health diplomacy over the past two decades. This Series paper argues that a more central role of international relations concepts and theories in analysing global health diplomacy would help develop a more nuanced understanding of global health policy making. However, the world has changed to an extent that was not envisioned in academic discourse. This shift calls for new international relations concepts and theories to inform global health diplomacy.}

abstract = {As the globally increasing population drives rapid urbanization in various parts of the world, there is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living. In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain.}

abstract = {In February 2024, the Council and the European Parliament (EP) agreed on the Artificial Intelligence Regulation (usually known as AI Act, AIA)11We use the AI Act version P9_TA(2024)0138 Artificial Intelligence Act European Parliament legislative resolution of 13 March 2024 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union Legislative Acts (COM(2021)0206–C9-0146/2021–2021/0106(COD)). https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138_EN.pdf. This regulation evaluates AI applications to ensure they are used ethically and responsibly, promoting the development of safe and lawful AI across the EU's single market. It establishes a comprehensive legal framework with a risk-based approach, aiming to achieve a balance between protecting the health, safety, and fundamental rights of European citizens and ensuring that the growing AI industry in Europe remains competitive and continues to innovate. The AIA also includes governance mechanisms oriented towards achieving effective implementation throughout the EU. For this purpose, a European Artificial Intelligence Office has already been established. In accordance with the provisions of the forthcoming AIA, it will establish a European Artificial Intelligence Board, an advisory forum, and a scientific panel. Furthermore, it will be set up at the national level the so-called national competent authorities. In this way, a single European governance system for AI is emerging, inspired by collaborative governance, which is essential for achieving fair and effective implementation of AI regulations across the EU. The main objective of this text is to critically examine the governance system established by the AIA. Using the contents of the current version of the AIA (April 2024), this analysis delves into the mechanisms and structures designed to implement AI across the EU. As a conclusion, it offers a critical perspective on the collaborative governance, highlighting its strengths and potential areas for improvement.}

Its baseline is the available standardised and harmonised methods for nanotechnology developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In order to identify improvements and needs for new themes in standardisation work, an analysis of the state-of-the-art concepts and interpretations of risk governance of nanotechnology was performed. Eleven overall areas of action were identified, each including a subset of specific topics. Themes addressed include physical chemical characterisation, assessment of hazard, exposure, risk and socio-economic factors, as well as education & training and social dialogue. This has been visualised in a standardisation roadmap spanning a timeframe of ten years and including key outcomes and highlights of the analysis. Furthermore, the roadmap indicates potential areas of action for harmonisation and standardisation (H&S) for nanomaterials and nanotechnology. It also includes an evaluation of the current level (limited, moderate, intense) of ongoing H&S activities and indicates the time horizon for the different areas of action. As the identified areas differ in their state of development, the number and type of actions varied widely amongst the different actions towards achieving standardisation. Thus, priority areas were also identified. The overall objective of these actions is to strengthen risk governance towards a safe use of nanomaterials and nano-related products. Though not explicitly addressed, risk-based legislation and policies are supported via the proposed H&S actions.}

Synthesising these, a research approach is adopted in which a Technological Innovation System (TIS) analysis is combined with a transformational perspective to identify a broader range of success and failure factors. This study analyses smart grid innovation system development. The main research question is: What systemic and transformational failures are identified in the development of smart grid innovation in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2021 by combining TIS and a transformational perspective? The question is answered by mapping the events to TIS functions and identifying both ‘systemic failures’ and ‘transformational failures’. Transformational failures are linked to events outside the smart grid TIS that work against the alignment and harmonising of activities within the TIS. Results show that the smart grid innovation system experienced three periods and that it suffers from various structural and transformational failures. TIS functions like knowledge diffusion, and the creation of legitimacy were only fulfilled to a limited extent. Consequently, smart grid innovation is currently still not considered a mainstream technology in the energy transition, and there is little attention to the role of end-users. The study ends with suggestions for future research, including the suitability of the research approach for other contexts and when applied to other energy system innovations.}

These strides have, in turn, impacted smart eco-cities, catalyzing ongoing improvements and driving solutions to address complex environmental challenges. This aligns with the visionary concept of smarter eco-cities, an emerging paradigm of urbanism characterized by the seamless integration of advanced technologies and environmental strategies. However, there remains a significant gap in thoroughly understanding this new paradigm and the intricate spectrum of its multifaceted underlying dimensions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leading-edge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.}

Health care governance research has traditionally had a strong focus on the size and composition (i.e., the attributes) of the governing bodies, but less attention has been given to the dynamics, processes, and roles. Furthermore, evidence regarding the interconnection between the board and the executive management is lacking. This systematic literature review is thus intended to give a detailed summary of the attributes, the dynamics, and the processes, as well as the roles of governing bodies, by synthesizing the findings of published empirical studies. The framework of Kane et al. (2009) was used to position the results, taking into account external constraints and outputs/performance. Sixty-three studies were included in the systematic review. The majority of these studies deal with attributes (n = 34) and roles (n = 27); the smallest number of studies (n = 11) focus on dynamics and processes. There is a lack of consistency in the research findings on attributes and there is too little research into the dynamics and processes of hospital governance. However, it has been shown that clinical participation on the hospital board and the focus on quality in hospital board roles can have a beneficial effect. The studies do not provide sufficient direction on what best practice for governing hospitals should be. For this reason, we here provide a useful framework for understanding the aspects of governance and their impact on performance in hospitals and compare these with general corporate governance literature. Therefrom we propose avenues for further research.}

However, the domination of human-induced drivers such as climate change, rapid demographic escalation, alteration in land use, industrialisation, and an increase in water demand has further stressed the unfrozen freshwater resources. This review provides a comprehensive literature-based analysis on different assessment methodologies for groundwater governance, and critically analysed the applicability and knowledge gaps in the assessment methodologies for evaluating groundwater governance under climatic and nonclimatic stresses. Furthermore, in the absence of a designated groundwater governance framework under stress, the study emphasized the need for developing a ready-to-use groundwater governance framework to assess the existing state of governance, tackling the prevailing knowledge gaps. A multidimensional framework consisting of key groundwater governance elements, the inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalised groups, current and future stressors, and an approach for aggregating multiple elements would overcome the limitations in previous assessment methodologies. Additionally, this framework would contribute to understanding current governance provisions and the capacity to manage those provisions, realise the strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement, and quantitatively visualise the prevailing state of groundwater governance for planning multiple strategies to possible threats and conflicts from the stresses.

In these cities, IoT technology generates vast amounts of data at any given time, which is analyzed to provide services to citizens. In the proper implementation of these cities, a critical challenge is the violation of citizens' privacy and security, which leads to a lack of trust and pessimism toward the services of the smart city. To ensure citizens' participation, smart city developers should adequately protect their security and privacy from gaining their trust. If citizens don't want to participate, the main benefits of a smart city will be lost. This article presents a comprehensive review of smart city security issues and privacy. It provides a basis for categorizing current and future developments in this area and developing a thematic classification to highlight the requirements and security strategies for designing a smart and safe city. The paper identifies current security and privacy solutions and describes open research challenges and issues. An output of this study is a systematic map of literature on the subject that identifies critical concepts, evidence, challenges, solutions, and gaps.

The complex problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is spread across human health, animal health, and the environment. The Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR and context-specific national action plans (NAPs) were developed to combat this problem. To date, there is no systematic content analysis of NAPs from countries of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN). As the validity periods of most NAPs are ending, an analysis now will provide an opportunity to improve subsequent iterations of these NAPs. We analysed the current NAPs of ten ASEAN countries. We explored their objective alignment with GAP and performed content analysis using an AMR governance framework. Themes were broadly classified under five governance areas: policy design, implementation tools, monitoring and evaluation, sustainability, and One Health engagement. We identified policy priorities, useful features of NAPs, and specific areas that should be strengthened, including accountability, sustained engagement, equity, behavioural economics, sustainability plans and transparency, international collaboration, as well as integration of the environmental sector. Enhancement of these areas and adoption of best practices will drive improved policy formulation and its translation into effective implementation.}

The ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, smartphones, social and cloud computing are reshaping urban conglomerates, worldwide. Cities can harness these ubiquitous technologies in concert with traditional methods for betterment of air quality governance and to improve quality of life. This paper discusses the role of urban computing in UAQM through a review of scientific publications and ‘grey literature’ from technical reports of governments, international organizations and institutional websites. It provides an interdisciplinary knowledge repository on urban computing applications for air quality functions. It highlights the potential of integrated technologies in enabling data driven, strategic and real-time mitigation governance actions and helping citizens to take informed decisions.

abstract = {Background
The application of autonomous technology in food supply chains gives rise to a number of ethical considerations associated with the interaction between human and technology, human-technology-plant and human-technology-animal. These considerations and their implications influence technology design, the ways in which technology is applied, how the technology changes food supply chain practices, decision-making and the associated ethical aspects and outcomes.
Scope and approach
Using the concept of reflexive governance, this paper has critiqued existing reflective food-related ethical assessment tools and proposed the structural elements required for reflexive governance architectures which address both the sharing of data, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in food supply chains.
Key findings and conclusions
Considering the ethical implications of using autonomous technology in real life contexts is challenging. The current approach, focusing on discrete ethical elements in isolation e.g., ethical aspects or outcomes, normative standards or ethically orientated compliance-based business strategies, is not sufficient in itself. Alternatively, the application of more holistic, reflexive governance architectures can inform consideration of ethical aspects, potential ethical outcomes, in particular how they are interlinked and/or interdependent, and the need for mitigation at all lifecycle stages of technology and food product conceptualisation, design, realisation and adoption in the food supply chain. This research is of interest to those who are undertaking ethical deliberation on data sharing, and the use of AI and machine learning in food supply chains.}

A more holistic systems framing can ensure that ‘smart’ solutions better address sustainability broadly and extend to issues of equity, power, agency, nature-based solutions and ecological resilience. In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems.

One means of increasing autonomy is by incorporating intelligent (i.e., smart) technologies into the mission architecture and habitat design. As plans for sending humans to deep space continue to develop and mature, identifying current and emerging smart technologies and which have the potential to enable these missions or maintain habitability for the crew can be used to explore design options prioritized for autonomous operations.

Most applications based on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) are still in the initial developmental stages and are yet to be adequately validated and shown to contribute to positive patient outcomes. There is also no consistent or comprehensive digitalization plan, and insufficient data are a limiting factor across all of these areas. In this article, we first consider how digitalization along nephrology care pathways relates to the Learning Health System initiative. We then consider the current state of AI/ML-based software and devices in nephrology and the ethical and regulatory challenges in scaling them up toward broader clinical application. We conclude with our proposal to establish a dedicated ethics and governance framework that is centered around health care providers in nephrology and the AI/ML-based software to which their work relates. This framework should help to integrate ethical and regulatory values and considerations, involve a wide range of stakeholders, and apply across normative domains that are conventionally demarcated as clinical, research, and public health.}

The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.}

It is: integrative, to ensure local solutions also have sustainable impacts elsewhere (across scales, places, issues and sectors); inclusive, to empower those whose interests are currently not being met and represent values embodying transformative change for sustainability; adaptive, enabling learning, experimentation, and reflexivity, to cope with the complexity of transformative change; and pluralist, recognizing different knowledge systems.

abstract = {The application of crowdsourced data holds transformative potential in reshaping decision-making processes. However, effectively harnessing the power of crowdsourced data within the complex landscape of urban tourism governance, especially in China marked by rapid growth and dynamic shifts in the tourism market, remains hindered by institutional constraints and capacity limitations. This study critically examines three pivotal challenges in urban tourism governance in China, stemming from the ever-evolving tourism demand dynamics: resource management, tourism promotion, and regional collaboration. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for tourism governance that capitalizes on crowdsourced data, comprising eight distinct analytical functions. To validate the efficacy of this novel approach grounded in crowdsourced information, empirical tests were conducted in Shenzhen and Jiangmen, China, using data sourced from Dianping.com, often dubbed the “Yelp of China.” The dataset encompassed 1,496 tourist attractions and 184,357 tourist reviews for Shenzhen, along with 559 attractions and 2,811 reviews for Jiangmen. By leveraging the proposed framework and its designated functions, we formulate policy recommendations for the advancement of tourism in Shenzhen and Jiangmen. Finally, we explore the potential advantages of adopting the crowdsourced information-based approach to tourism management, shedding light on its implications for both governmental and corporate entities.}

abstract = {To transform urban areas into smart cities, various technologies—including software, user interfaces, communication networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT)—must tackle complex sustainability and resilience issues. This study aims to investigate the challenges of rapid urban population growth and explore how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be utilized to foster the development of smart cities. Specifically, it seeks to understand how the integration of ICT can contribute to enhancing urban resilience, promoting urban sustainability, and improving citizens' quality of life. The study relied on a literature review, appraisals of fifteen (15) different Smart City software applications and their characteristics (spanning various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, all related to sustainability and resilience), and thirty (30) case studies cutting across sustainability and resilience. Furthermore, thematic analysis from the case studies was used to evaluate the benefits of smart city applications mapped to the six (6) action areas of Smart City. Based on the findings from case studies and smart city software analysis, rapid urbanisation presents multifaceted challenges like traffic congestion, disaster management, environmental degradation, community engagement, economic disparities, and so on. However, adopting Smart City software applications and aligning with various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, play pivotal roles in addressing these challenges. Further findings reveal that the benefits of smart city software align with the action areas of smart cities, including Governance, Mobility, Economy, Environment, Living, and People. The research offers practical application of smart city software for Urban designs and planners. It highlights the influence of contextual factors across countries on Smart City effectiveness. The study advances ICT-driven urban transformation, enhancing the quality of life in fast-growing cities.}

It concentrates on the role of and interaction between stakeholders and technology in the smart city transformation process. Knowledge and insight into these developmental processes and core scenarios are scarce and necessary, as they can contribute to a possible acceleration and increase in the effectiveness of smart city transformation strategies. As a result of a systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b) downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback. Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the smart city processes in which they participate.}

The study used an integrative literature review based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The result of the review indicated that lack of appropriate policies and political commitment, lack of knowledge of CSA technologies by smallholder farmers, institutional constraints, and financial constraints were identified as the main challenges to the adoption of CSA technologies and practices, while the availability of resources in the form of projects, programs, technologies, practices, and other applications were opportunities for policymakers, advisors, and farmers. Therefore, there is a need for the linkage of farmers, researchers, and extension practitioners, considering appropriate sets of CSA interventions of relevant scale, selected and tailored to local specific contexts and livelihood needs.}

While previous studies have made valuable contributions to this field, the current state of literature reviews still requires a comprehensive examination to construct the knowledge map for future research. This study employed scientometric analyses, including collaboration network analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and co-citation network analysis, to examine 1133 previous articles conducted between 2015 and 2023 concerning the research topic of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing. The findings reveal that the academic communities in this field comprise influential authors affiliated with leading academic institutions in China, India, and the USA. The key research topics of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing show evolutionary trends during different research periods. Existing research on AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing is supported by classical references, which can be divided into four significant co-citation clusters, including the theory of security and privacy in CPS, DL-based IDS, DDoS attacks on CPS by botnet, and FL method for privacy-preserved data sharing. Finally, this study predicted four potential future research directions for the research field of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing: the well-structured and representative dataset for model training, methods for resisting PUF attacks against ML techniques, DL-based methods for detecting and resisting botnets, and lightweight FL-based methods for privacy-preserved data sharing.

There are different dimensions that are to be considered for smart city planning and implementation. This complexity of the dimension, the use of technology, and their integration bring the risk perspectives into the implementation of the smart city concept. If such risks are not adequately understood and addressed, they can create issues in terms of privacy and security and, therefore, the functioning of smart cities. In this review, the identification of dimensions, smart city assessment tools, the available technologies, and the technical and non-technical risk parameters related to smart cities implementation are discussed. The current methods of risk assessment and the possible enhancements are highlighted. The findings of the literature review illustrate that not all smart cities adapt all of the smart city dimensions. The dominant technology used in smart cities’ applications is found to be the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain.

The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications. Finally, based on a literature review, the study highlights the current challenges and future directions related to multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities, which provide a roadmap for the optimized operation of megacities and smart city systems.}

The ability of smart healthcare strategies to improve efficiency, patient's outcomes and delivery of quality healthcare has motivated and committed governments and policy makers to invest in this innovation. However, uptake and usage of smart healthcare strategies has not been successful as anticipated, and this is due to a number of challenges faced by different stakeholders during the adoption of these strategies. The objective of this paper is to systematically check published literature to identify and compile a comprehensive list of challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. Knowledge of these potential challenges gives stakeholders awareness and better prospects of dealing with the challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. A systematic literature review was conducted. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for full text, peer reviewed, English language articles that reported the challenges for successful adoption of smart healthcare management strategies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to select eligible articles. After the full screening, 26 articles that met the criteria were analysed and reported. Three main themes of challenges that affect the adoption of smart healthcare strategies have been identified based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. The findings of this study demonstrate that different TOE challenges affect smart health strategies adoption by healthcare sector. This study, therefore, proposes a differentiated approach to policies and practices to effectively scale up adoption of smart health and reduce failure rates of smart health projects. It is concluded that future research is needed in identifying key change management strategies to successfully manage the identified challenges to improve the prospects of successful adoption of smart healthcare strategies.}

IoT (Internet of Things) systems are at the centre of smart city applications, as traditional cloud computing is insufficient for satisfying the critical requirements of smart IoT systems. Due to the nature of smart city applications, massive IoT data may contain sensitive information; hence, various privacy-preserving methods, such as anonymity, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, have been utilised over the years. Furthermore, limited concern has been given to the resource consumption for data privacy-preserving in edge computing environments, which are resource-constrained when compared with cloud data centres. In particular, differential privacy (DP) has been an effective privacy-preserving method in the edge computing environment. However, there is no dedicated study on DP technology with a focus on smart city applications in the edge computing environment. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study on DP in edge computing-based smart city applications, covering various aspects, such as privacy models, research methods, mechanisms, and applications. Our study focuses on five areas of data privacy, including data transmitting privacy, data processing privacy, data model training privacy, data publishing privacy, and location privacy. In addition, we investigate many potential applications of DP in smart city application scenarios. Finally, future directions of DP in edge computing are envisaged. We hope this study can be a useful roadmap for researchers and practitioners in edge computing enable smart city applications.}

The way of the MCDM combined with geographical information system (GIS) techniques provides a significant aspect to consider when developing a flood risk model or early warning system. A case study of flood risk assessment in the Shanghai is used to demonstrate the application of the MCDM techniques incorporating GIS to assess flood risk of metro system. The assessed flood risk of metro systems provides inceptive suggestions for designing flood prevention in metro systems. Based on the initial flood risk of metro systems, a large amount of data collected using 3S including remote sensing (RS), GIS, global position system (GPS) technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and wireless sensor networks, can be adopted to increase the accuracy of flood risk management for metro systems in smart city development. The processing and analysis of big data obtained from wireless sensor networks and AI technologies provides a way of establishing an intelligent technology system for flood management in smart city development.}

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.}

However, the advancement in smart packing technologies has mainly involved petroleum-based plastics. Consequently, it is imminent that these smart technologies should be geared toward emerging plant-based packing materials.

These advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. What challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing AI, AIoT, and UDT in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? Methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between January 2019 and December 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. The findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating AI, AIoT, and UDT technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. By enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. However, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. This study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development. These insights have profound implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing a roadmap for fostering resiliently designed, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious urban environments.}

abstract = {Target-based governance holds the promise of accountability by measuring progress towards objectives set within global environmental agreements. This approach has been widely adopted at multiple scales of governance in conservation and sustainability sectors including by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Yet the implications of governing through targets have not been fully scrutinized for the ways that targets and their associated indicators shape the work by global conventions, including the activities pursued by state and non-state actors. We systematically reviewed, coded and assessed the peer-reviewed scientific literature produced in relation to the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABTs) to demonstrate the types of scientific action that the Aichi targets have motivated, and assess how this work serves to reinforce particular visions of what conservation is and how it should be done. We find widespread support for target-based governance in the scientific literature. We also find uneven attention across the targets (e.g. mostly the protected areas target), to particular elements within specific targets (e.g. the area-based element of the protected areas target), measured by particular forms of knowledge (i.e. primarily biophysical data aggregated at a global scale). We argue that the uneven scientific action associated with the ABTs arises from the interplay among target elements that can be readily measured (e.g. by existing single-metric indicators) and long-standing institutional commitments (e.g. to protected areas expansion). With the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework on the immediate horizon, there is a timely opportunity to reflect on the role of targets within the CBD and beyond.}

abstract = {The adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies has revolutionized agricultural practices worldwide. However, their application in the context of sub-Saharan Africa remains a critical challenge. This study presents a systematic review that investigates the potential of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation. Sub-Saharan Africa faces multiple agricultural challenges, exacerbated by climate change, water scarcity, and inefficient irrigation practices. The need for sustainable, water-efficient, and data-driven irrigation systems is urgent to ensure food security and economic development in the region. This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap by assessing the constraints, opportunities, and prospects of implementing 4IR technologies for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review methodology was employed, utilizing reputable databases including Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and PubMed. A comprehensive search strategy was designed to identify peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and reports related to the application of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Big Data, and Blockchain technology in smart irrigation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was used to arrive at 95 articles included in this research. The review reveals promising trends in the integration of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation. 4IR technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data technology, Blockchain and drones are widely used in smart irrigation. These technologies have facilitated real time monitoring of soil moisture and weather conditions, precision irrigation scheduling, water allocation optimization, rapid data collection, insights in real time crop water use and transparency and trust in agricultural water management among others. While the potential of 4IR technologies is evident, challenges including limited infrastructure, access to technology, and technical expertise pose significant barriers for the adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the high initial costs associated with these technologies can impede widespread adoption. The study highlights the potential to leverage existing mobile phone penetration for IoT data collection, collaborative partnerships, and innovative financing models to overcome financial constraints. Capacity-building initiatives and knowledge transfer can empower local communities to embrace these technologies. The future of smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa relies on policy support, investments, and technology diffusion strategies. It is imperative to create an enabling environment that fosters innovation and addresses the unique needs of the region. Collaboration between governments, academia, industry, and international organizations can catalyze the transformative impact of 4IR technologies, ultimately enhancing irrigation sustainability and food security.}

This characteristic makes smart urban metabolism a strategic tool for urban policymakers and managers, and planners. Nonetheless, little is known on about the indicators of smart urban metabolism. This study aims to shed light on what the specific indicators of smart urban metabolism are. The paper places international standards and indicators of urban systems under the microscope to determine their focus, and areas of action. The analysis exposes divergences in urban system evaluation approaches by international standardization organizations—particularly with a focus on whether they concentrate on urban smartness or urban metabolism. The results of the analysis demonstrate a challenge in integrating urban metabolism with urban smartness. In this sense, there is no international standard taken into consideration thus far. The study points out to a novel and invaluable approach to improve the understanding and awareness on internationally standardized urban indicators that characterize, and stimulate the knowledge on smart urban metabolism.}

To analyse these hydrogen SCLs, we embellish a novel conceptual framework that brings together Sustainability, Systems Thinking, and Governance (SSG) literatures. The results reveal noteworthy scheme differences in motivation, approach, criteria, and governance; highlighting the complex, interconnected, and dynamic reality within which energy systems are embedded. We consider whether the sustainable utilisation of renewable hydrogen is well-served by the proliferation of SCLs and recommend an SSG-informed approach. An SSG approach will better promote collaboration towards an authoritative, global, multistakeholder, compromise on hydrogen certification that balances economic considerations with social, and environmental dimensions.}

Drawing on previous work on feminist home-city geographies, this paper proposes four analytical frames for reflecting on the relationship between urban and domestic space in digital geographies: governance, domestication, thresholds, and dwelling. The paper explores each lens through a critical review of recent literature in digital geographies and related fields. It weaves this review through a speculative reading of the Eco Delta Smart City, an experimental development building the smart city from the home up in Busan, South Korea. We show how each lens calls attention to distinct sets of questions, actors, agendas, and relations–thus refusing any single reading of the project or of the broader trends around digitalization of which it is a part. In the process, we trace how digitalization does not simply trouble existing spatial categories, but rather makes them manifest in new ways for differently situated subjects.}

An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.}

Here, we review 186 energy modelling studies and identify challenges and opportunities for the energy modelling community to take into account and facilitate multi-level governance systems. We show that current energy modelling practices typically focus on and aim to support a single scale, largely overlooking the multi-level nature of energy governance. Embedding multi-level governance throughout the energy modelling process entails significant obstacles but is crucial for ensuring such approaches continue to provide timely and salient decision-support.}

To achieve this goal, artificial intelligence, particularly, machine learning analytical modeling can be employed to provide deeper knowledge about city data, which makes the computing process more actionable and intelligent in various real-world city services. Finally, we identify and highlight ten open research issues for future development and research in the context of data-driven smart cities.

Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.}

This was done by automating and digitizing the grid to give it the right amount of flexibility and reliability, while also giving it the ability to easily handle future changes. The need for SG exponentially increases as more variable renewable energy sources are integrated into the power system, with the power grid and the electricity market gradually being transformed from a centralized to a more distributed form. In this respect, the objective of this review paper is to highlight the pertinent challenges associated with SG that are necessary for its progressive practical realization from the perspective of user-end acceptance as well as operational flexibility for power system planners and operators in terms of regulatory and serviceability needs. Furthermore, it intends to highlight the complexities of power system related to planning, operation, and installation considering renewable integration, such that, the progression and utilization of SG can be quantified while highlighting research gaps that could potentially have a catastrophic impact, such as, standardization and protocols related to contingencies a especially black-start process. Therefore, a bottom-up approach for reviewing SG is carried out in this paper, which provides an in-depth presentation on the description and challenges associated with renewable integration, energy storage systems, security, and interoperability, along with comprehensive discussion on progressive research on their potential solutions and countermeasures.}

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature in AIoT and Federated Learning (FL) for SA. It identifies current and potential challenges and provides research direction for the future investment in both academia and industry.}

Access to these data can allow healthcare professionals to receive additional information that will assist in decision-making and the provision of additional support. Given the diverse sources of PGHD, this review aims to provide evidence on PGHD integration with electronic health records (EHR), models and standards for PGHD exchange with EHR, and PGHD-EHR policy design and development. The review also addresses governance and socio-technical considerations in PGHD management. Databases used for the review include PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink and ACM Digital Library. The review reveals the significance, but current deficiency, of provenance, trust and contextual information as part of PGHD integration with EHR. Also, we find that there is limited work on data quality, and on new data sources and associated data elements, within the design of existing standards developed for PGHD integration. New data sources from emerging technologies like mixed reality, virtual reality, interactive voice response system, and social media are rarely considered. The review recommends the need for well-developed designs and policies for PGHD-EHR integration that promote data quality, patient autonomy, privacy, and enhanced trust.}

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to address climate change impacts, it also raises many application limitations and challenges. A risk governance perspective is used to analyze the role of AI in supporting decision-making for climate adaptation, spanning risk assessment, policy analysis, and implementation. This comprehensive review combines expert insights and systematic literature review. The study’s findings indicate a large emphasis on applying AI to climate “risk assessments,” particularly regarding hazard and exposure assessment, but a lack of innovative approaches and tools to evaluate resilience and vulnerability as well as prioritization and implementation process, all of which involve subjective, qualitative, and context-specific elements. Additionally, the study points out challenges such as difficulty of simulating complex long-term changes, and evolving policies and human behavior, reliance on data quality and computational resources, and the need for improved interpretability of results as areas requiring further development.}

Without venturing into the wide range of governance paradigms, this research considers governance structures based on trust as a foundation for BC governance. A thematic systematic literature review is conducted to understand the literature on this topic, employing the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) technique. An examination of 155 papers shows that using BC technology (BCT) replaces the cognitive attribution of trust in the material and human-independent code. It is also found that further research anchored to the ‘trust’ concept is required in building BC governance structures. To provide the direction in which the literature is travelling, future research questions on trust and governance are documented. In general, the literature review suggests that BC has the potential to revolutionize the way in which businesses operate. By improving transparency, efficiency, and security, BC can help businesses to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and make better decisions. This research can help policymakers, industrialists, and researchers to identify where BC governance is being used and which aspects of governance are to be focused on. This paper is a general review of literature and evidence on contemporary developmental issues.}

We review recent applications of CPS, highlighting their diverse functions across the water cycle, including in rural, urban and coastal settings. We then focus on how smart technologies connect to people, policy and ecosystems. Key to our argument is that integrating the social and ecosystem dimensions into CPS research and design will be vital for sustainable transformations in water management and governance, as per a cybernetic approach. This includes consideration of social data requirements, end-user experience, sociopolitical and environmental impacts, as well as acceptability, of CPS.}

We argue that emerging technologies for sustainability in energy and food systems present unique problems of resource governance, insofar as the neoliberal state enables energy and agritech firm hegemony at the expense of local producers. Albeit unevenly, such technological interventions have brought some social and environmental benefits to people and the environment. However, we contend that the constellation of institutions, policies and regulatory approaches that govern these technologies in agrarian spaces constitute regimes of dispossession—socially and historically specific political apparatuses for coercively redistributing resources.}

When the imperative of urban economic and spatial growth is taken as a given, the mechanisms that perpetuate it remain unexplored and unquestioned. Lack of attention to such mechanisms, and specifically the politics of urban land use, can lead to ineffective planning and maladaptation. In this review, we explore the intersection of scholarship on urban climate adaptation governance and the political economy of urban development to identify the specific contemporary mechanisms that perpetuate uneven patterns of urban vulnerability and undermine adaptation planning. We are guided by three questions: What are the mechanisms that urban managers employ to assign rights and responsibilities to land, and thus allocate spatial exposure to risk? How is land implicated in cities’ efforts to finance themselves and their activities, and what are the implications for adaptation? What mechanisms enable urban actors to protect themselves from risk and respond to uncertainty? We emphasize the need to place urban climate governance within the broader political dynamics of urban development for more effective, equitable and ultimately sustainable vulnerability interventions. We find that instruments of urban development are often supporting the prioritization of economic rewards over equitable and just distribution of risk and rights to adaptation benefits. We conclude by highlighting the “uncomfortable knowledge” that if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved, the mechanisms of urban development and associated actors that shape, steer and utilize these instruments for a variety of means and goals, must be made visible and addressed.}

Digital technologies play an increasingly important role in addressing environmental challenges, such as climate change and resource depletion. Yet, the characteristics and implications of digitalized environmental governance are still under-conceptualized. In this perspective, we distinguish three dimensions of governance: (1) seeing and knowing, (2) participation and engagement, and (3) interventions and actions. For each dimension, we provide a critical perspective on the shifts that digital technologies generate in governance. We argue against the assumption that the use of digital technologies automatically results in improved outcomes or in more democratic decision-making. Instead, attention needs to be paid to the wider political and normative context in which digital technologies are proposed, designed, and used as environmental governance tools. We conclude with key questions for academics and policymakers to broaden the debate on responsible design and use of digital technologies in environmental governance.}

However, there could also be underlying factors that limit success. In this paper we present the results of a systematic literature review to outline the potential co-benefits and risks of taking a SLES approach to energy system change. This review identifies multiple potential co-benefits, as well as a range of risk factors which could affect delivery. In addition, we identified that several co-benefits are interconnected, whereby certain co-benefits cannot occur until other co-benefits have first been achieved. We propose three dimensions of SLES co-benefits and risks: process, impact, and distribution to aid understanding of how, where, why and when these co-benefits or risks could arise and who might be in receipt of them. However, we conclude that a more co-ordinated approach across a range of stakeholders is required to maximise beneficial outputs and to ameliorate risks.}

The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.}

Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.}

In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term “smart city” are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed.

It maps key research themes, identifies research trends and provides a deeper understanding of the governance literature on DBSS. We searched the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases to identify 95 papers written in English or Chinese between 2016 and 2019 that address the governance of DBSS. A thematic coding of these papers was supported by bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping using the VOSviewer. More papers are written in Chinese rather than English, focusing on Chinese cities. Although the time range of our literature search was between 2016 and 2019, the first paper was published in 2017. Four key themes in the governance of DBSSs were identified within the papers, and over time the papers shifted their focus from problem-finding and problem-defining to problem-solving. Discussion of the inherent characteristics of the sharing economy and the externalities underpinning the governance of DBSS (Theme 1) and rebalancing problems for DBSS (Theme 2) first arose in early 2017, whilst discussions of the government regulation of DBSS (Themes 3) and the cross-boundary governance models underpinning DBSS (Themes 4) first arose in mid-2017. This paper concludes with a discussion of the identified themes and trends in the context of the broader literature on bicycle sharing and identifies opportunities for further research.}

Recent attention to the developments focusing on the educational services has been noteworthy, with the educational environment specifically the smart campus emerging both as a domain and as an opportunity. As a domain worthy of exploration, a number of research efforts are being conceptualized around smart campus initiatives. The existing bouquet of research publications on smart campus provides a testimony of the enthusiasm and also exposes the heterogeneous attempts the domain has witnessed to date. The available evidence is still inadequate to provide clarity on the thrust areas of research around smart campus.
Design/methodology/approach
Given the understanding, this study intends to decode the domain to get an early impression of the focus of the research concentration around smart campus. Thereby the study resorts to an automated text-mining approach using Python on contents shortlisted systematically, and published between the period 2010 and May 2022, from select databases.
Findings
Based on the analysis it was possible to identify eight themes (i.e. smart campus characteristics, smart campus stakeholders, smart campus frameworks, smart campus technologies, smart campus infrastructure, smart campus evaluation, smart learning environment and smart campus applications) characterizing research efforts within the smart campus literature.
Originality/value
The themes around the smart campus showcase the thrust areas receiving attention. These characterize extant research endeavours in the smart campus domain and can offer useful pointers to researchers going forward. This awareness can also be beneficial to institutional leadership and technology providers intending to implement smart campus initiatives, contributing to the development of the educational environment.}

abstract = {The evolution of the Spanish cities towards their digital transformation, integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), and improvement of social cohesion have been promoted by the government. However, this evolution has not yet been evaluated, and this assessment is considerably relevant as more than 200 M€ has been spent from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through five calls divided into two national plans (2014–2020). In this evaluation, the projects of 61 beneficiary local entities have been analysed. The lines of action executed have been identified and compared, using standardised indicators, with the actions conducted in the European metropolis that are smart city references. The actions planned in the last call (Smart Territories National Plan) closely resemble the philosophy of the latest generation paradigm of smart cities (holistic approach and specialisation in topics such as tourism or intelligent buildings) from the initial point where the areas of technology, software, and governance were focused. This work offers a precise picture of the priorities and lines of the progress of smart cities at each period of the last decade and helps technicians and investigators evaluate executed projects and design new lines of development.}

abstract = {Recent urban debates on the governance of sustainability transformations have witnessed an 'infrastructural turn'. Previously blacked-boxed, the role of infrastructures in sustainability transformations has been foregrounded by both growing academic scholarship and major investments in new infrastructural programs. How these changes are, and could be, governed remains somewhat opaque however, with traditional forms of knowledge and practices in need of urgent revision. To nuance public and academic debates, this paper synthesizes emerging approaches to the governance of transformative infrastructural change, revealing their underlying logics and potential contributions. These include appraisal of; alternative infrastructural pathways via ‘futuring’, their enactment via experimentation processes, supported by cross-domain coordination and new assessment methods. Such approaches may open new directions toward urban sustainability but also surface tensions and contradictions inherent to the governance of infrastructures.}
